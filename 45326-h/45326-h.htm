<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Dear Boys</span>:</p>

<p>In this, the ninth of the books in the “Motor
Boys Series,” Jerry, Ned and Bob decide that as
they have had a number of adventures on land
and water, the only place left for them to see
sights is up in the air, above the clouds. At first
this plan was considered rather dubious, as, though
considerable progress has been made toward men
sailing about in the upper regions by means of
dirigible balloons or aeroplanes, the science is still
far from perfected.</p>

<p>But when the boys had attended an aero carnival,
and witnessed the flight of a large dirigible
balloon, they decided there was nothing for them
to do but to attempt a trip that way themselves.</p>

<p>They formed the acquaintance of a veteran balloon
constructor, who had a plan for a novel motor
ship. This combined a dirigible balloon and an
aeroplane, and after some consideration the boys
furnished him the money to build one.</p>

<p>All was not smooth sailing, literally as well as
figuratively speaking. They had a number of difficulties,
not the least of which were caused by their
old enemy, Noddy Nixon. How they finally started,
the accidents that befell them, and the long
trip they made for fame, and not a little fortune,
in the shape of a substantial prize, you will find
set down in the succeeding pages.</p>

<p>The welcome you boys have accorded the previous
books in this series makes me hope that you
will also like this one. The conquest of the air
is coming nearer every year, and who knows but
that the Motor Boys may be the ones who will be
among the first to solve it.</p>

<p class="noic">Yours cordially,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Clarence Young</span>.</p>

<small>NODDY NIXON’S TIN FLY</small></h2>


<p>“Hello, Ned! Say, Jerry, have you heard the
news?”</p>

<p>“What news, Chunky?”</p>

<p>“Why, about the carnival. It’s going to be
great. I thought sure you’d heard about it. Why,
there’s going to be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Look here, Bob Baker,” remarked Jerry Hopkins,
rolling over in the grass, where he was
stretched out under a big maple tree, “do you know
it’s about ninety in the shade to-day?”</p>

<p>“Sure I know it,” replied Bob, breathing rather
quickly, for he was quite stout, as his nickname of
“Chunky” implied; and he had hurried from his
house to see his two chums, Jerry Hopkins and Ned
Slade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, then, if you’re aware of that interesting
and very evident fact, why do you come around
here, puffing like a steam engine, and making all
sorts of a row, while Ned and I are trying to keep
cool and improve our minds?” asked Jerry, pretending
to be angry. “Why do you do it, I ask?”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d be anxious to hear the news.”</p>

<p>“What news?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother, Chunky,” put in Ned, stretching
and yawning. “The best news you could tell
us now would be that there was a freezer full of
ice cream somewhere within easy reach. If you’re
not ready to tell us something like that, why, take
a stretch down here in the shade, and don’t puff
so. You make me warm.”</p>

<p>“Well, say, if you don’t want to hear this, all
right,” replied Bob, a little put out at the manner
in which his announcement had been received.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother with him, Chunky,” yawned
Jerry. “If you have any news to tell, let it go.
I’m listening. What’s it about? Has our gold
mine failed, or has Professor Snodgrass discovered
some new species of man-eating hoptoad?”</p>

<p>“It’s got nothing to do with Professor Snodgrass,
or our gold mine, either,” responded Bob.
“But there’s going to be a great carnival at Broadlands,
and I thought maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Carnival? You mean a county fair, I suppose,”
interrupted Ned. “Excuse me. I can see all the
cattle and mowing machines I want right here at
home.”</p>

<p>“I guess your dad must have made you mow the
front lawn this morning, eh, Ned?” inquired Jerry
with a grin.</p>

<p>“That’s what he did, and it’s no front parlor
of a lawn, either. I don’t ever want to see a lawn-mower
again. But here comes Bob, all excited over
a county fair, where all they have to eat is frankfurters,
popcorn and ice cream cones.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so?” retorted the stout youth rather
indignantly. “Well, if you’re so smart, did you
ever hear of a county fair in July, before the crops
are in?”</p>

<p>“He’s got you there, Ned,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, what kind of a carnival is it?” asked
the youth who had endeavored to discount Bob’s
news. “Why don’t you tell us your story, instead
of hemming and hawing around here, like an automobile
that’s run out of gasolene and has a spark-plug
that’s gone on the fritz? Why don’t you,
eh?”</p>

<p>“I will, if you’ll give me a chance. There’s going
to be a carnival over at Broadlands and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You said that once before,” reminded Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go ahead, don’t mind him,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a balloon and aeroplane carnival,”
went on Chunky. “All sorts of airships
are to be exhibited, and there are going to be races.
It’s going to be great! They’re just putting up the
posters all around town.”</p>

<p>“Is that straight?” asked Ned, for Bob was
sometimes inclined to joke.</p>

<p>“Sure it is. Come on and I’ll show you the
posters. There’s one on our side fence. I let the
man stick it there.”</p>

<p>“And maybe your dad will make you take it
off,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I wanted to have a chance to
read it. But this carnival is going to be all right.
As soon as I heard of it I ran to find you two
fellows. Why can’t we go and take it in? It’s
only about seventy-five miles to Broadlands. There
are good roads, and we can go in our auto.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff! When is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Next week. It lasts six days.”</p>

<p>“If it’s as hot as this the gas balloons will explode
with the heat,” predicted Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll cool off before then,” declared Jerry.
“But what else, Bob? Did you look to see who any
of the entries were by? Are the Wright brothers
going to compete? Will Zeppelin send his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
big, long aluminum balloon over from Germany?
Captain Baldwin ought to be on hand,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice any of those names. I don’t
believe any of those big inventors will be on hand,
but I can tell you one person who’s going to have
an entry.”</p>

<p>Bob’s manner was so earnest, and he seemed
so worked up over his news, that both Ned and
Jerry lost their half-bantering air, and began to be
seriously interested.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon.”</p>

<p>“What? Noddy? That chump going to exhibit
an airship?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that it’s exactly an airship,” answered
Bob. “But it’s some sort of a machine
for sailing above the earth, or it wouldn’t be allowed
at the carnival.”</p>

<p>“But Noddy Nixon, of all the fellows in the
world!” commented Jerry.</p>

<p>“It does seem sort of queer,” admitted Bob.
“That’s what drew my attention to the posters. I
saw Noddy’s name on them.”</p>

<p>“Is his name on the posters?” chorused his two
companions.</p>

<p>“Sure. He’s one of the entrants; I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that’s the proper word,” said Bob, grinning. “His
machine is called the <i>Firefly</i>.”</p>

<p>“Does he expect to sail it himself?”</p>

<p>“What sort of a shebang is it?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell us before?”</p>

<p>“Queer we didn’t hear anything about it. He
must have been keeping it quiet.”</p>

<p>“Where did he get the gumption to invent it?”</p>

<p>These, and other questions and comments, Bob’s
two chums asked of him so quickly that he had
no chance to reply.</p>

<p>“That’s all I know about it,” he said, when
Ned and Jerry had to stop to get their breaths.
“What’s the matter with taking a run over to
Broadlands and finding out more about it? Maybe
we could get up a machine ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Not if the carnival takes place next week,” replied
Jerry, though there was a new look on his
face&mdash;a look which his companions knew indicated
that he was thinking deeply. Indeed, Bob’s news
had created quite an impression on Jerry, and
in a measure it was responsible for a series of
strange happenings which took place after that,
and in which the motor boys played conspicuous
parts.</p>

<p>“And is that all you can tell us?” asked Ned.
“What sort of a machine has Noddy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The interest of Ned and his two companions,
in what Noddy was about to take part in, was not
lessened by the fact that young Nixon, the town
bully, was their enemy, and, in the past, had done
much to annoy and injure them, though, usually,
his mean schemes went for naught, because of the
bravery and activity of the three boys against whom
he had a grudge.</p>

<p>“That’s all I know&mdash;what the posters said,” replied
Ned. “His name is only one of about twenty,
I guess. There are pictures of all sorts of airships,
but I didn’t see any that looked like a firefly.”</p>

<p>“Queer,” murmured Jerry. “I wonder what
sort of a machine Noddy has?”</p>

<p>“I can tell you,” exclaimed a voice behind the
motor boys. “It’s great&mdash;regular fly&mdash;tin wings&mdash;flop
up and down&mdash;faster than you can count&mdash;whoop!
there they go&mdash;up goes the machine&mdash;down
again&mdash;round in a circle&mdash;flip-flap-flop!
Start the motor&mdash;twist the rudder&mdash;look out&mdash;here
she comes&mdash;that’s the way!”</p>

<p>And the speaker, a small youth, very much excited,
had to stop, for he was out of breath, so
rapidly had he talked.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Andy Rush. No need to turn around
to tell that, boys,” remarked Jerry, stretching out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in the grass again. “Well, Andy, aren’t some of
your cylinders hot after that sprint?”</p>

<p>“I guess so&mdash;I don’t know&mdash;heard you talking
about Noddy Nixon&mdash;his airship&mdash;thought you
wouldn’t mind&mdash;I came up closer&mdash;I heard about
it&mdash;I’ve seen it&mdash;it’s great&mdash;say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Have an ice-cream soda,” interrupted Ned,
pretending to hand one to the excited little fellow.</p>

<p>“Aw, quit,” begged Andy reproachfully.</p>

<p>“That’s right, let him tell us about it,” suggested
Jerry. “Now just shut off a little of your
gasolene, retard your spark a bit, and you’ll do
better. How did you come to know about Noddy’s
machine?”</p>

<p>“Because he wanted me to try a flight in it. He
needs some one who is light, and he asked me. But
I wouldn’t do it. I’m afraid,” answered Andy
Rush.</p>

<p>“Did you see it?” asked Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“Sure. He had it built in Jenkinson’s machine
shop. But he’s been keeping quiet about it. I
guess he didn’t want you fellows to get on to it,
for fear you’d beat him out. He’s been working
on it for some time. Ever since he heard about
the carnival.”</p>

<p>Andy was speaking more quietly now, and his
three auditors listened intently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“And is it really shaped like a fly?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“It sure is. He took me over and showed it to
me yesterday. That’s when he wanted me to
sail it for him. It’s a big tin fly, with wings and
everything. Oh, it’s a queer-looking shebang. It’s
big, too.”</p>

<p>“How does it run?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“He’s got a little motor on it, one he took out
of his old auto, I guess. It makes the wings flap
up and down.”</p>

<p>“And he really thinks he can fly in it?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“He’s sure of it,” replied Andy. “He told me
how many flaps the wings made every second, but
I’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p>“What does he expect will make the machine
rise in the air?” asked Jerry. “Has he aeroplanes
or a balloon attached to it?”</p>

<p>“Nope. Nothing but a sort of car, shaped like
a fly’s body, and two wings on each side, with a
tail in back like that of a fish. He says the flopping
of the wings will make it rise up, same as a
bird flies.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t the limit!” exclaimed Jerry.
“He must be crazy. It is a heavy machine, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Sure. It takes four men to lift it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“And he expects to make it rise up by vibrating
tin wings,” went on Jerry. “Well, he is a
chump!”</p>

<p>“I am, eh? Well, maybe when you see me sailing
along through the air you won’t be so fresh!”
exclaimed a new voice, and the four boys, looking
up, saw Noddy Nixon, their enemy, standing not
far away. He had come up through the fields
back of Jerry Hopkins’ house, where the chums
were resting in the shade of a little grove, and he
had overheard the closing sentences of their conversation.</p>

<p>“I’m a chump, am I?” he went on angrily.
“Well, I’ve gotten the best of you more than once,
Jerry Hopkins, and I’ll do it again. The <i>Firefly</i>
will fly, and I know it, and if you slander me or my
machine any more I’ll sue you for damages. I’ll
fix you, Andy Rush, for giving my secrets away!”
and with an angry look on his mean, crafty face,
Noddy Nixon advanced toward the little fellow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>OFF TO THE CARNIVAL</small></h2>


<p>Andy Rush well knew Noddy’s character, and
he had no notion of remaining to be chastised by
the bully. He leaped to his feet and started to
run, Noddy taking after him. Andy fell on a
slippery patch of dried grass, and Noddy was almost
upon him when Jerry ran up.</p>

<p>“That’ll do you,” he said. “Let Andy alone.”</p>

<p>“I will not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t.”</p>

<p>“I’ll punch your head if you touch him.”</p>

<p>Noddy knew Jerry was as good as his word,
and as the bully had, more than once, felt Jerry’s
fists, he backed off.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got any right to make fun of my
machine,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t making fun of it,” replied Jerry.
“I was laughing at the idea of you expecting to sail
through the air with a machine so heavy it takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
four men to lift it, especially when you haven’t
any lifting power.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I s’pose you know a lot about airships?”
sneered Noddy.</p>

<p>“I know enough about ’em to know that a machine
heavier than air can’t rise unless there’s something
to give it a lift.”</p>

<p>“Aw, you think you’re awful smart. But you
wait. When you see me sailing around at the
carnival you’ll sing a different tune.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” admitted Jerry good-naturedly. “I
hope you do fly, Noddy, and don’t break your
neck.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I didn’t know you didn’t want me to tell
about the <i>Firefly</i>, Noddy,” remarked Andy, peering
out from around Jerry’s stocky form.</p>

<p>“Yes, you did, and I’ll fix you the first chance
I get. You wait.”</p>

<p>“Andy, if he bothers you just let me know,”
spoke Jerry significantly. “Don’t let him worry
you. If you attempt to injure Andy for what he
said to-day you’ll have to reckon with us, and you
can put that in your gasolene engine and use it for
fish bait,” added Jerry, looking at the bully.</p>

<p>“Aw, you think you’re smart,” was Noddy’s
half-growled retort. “But I’ll show folks what I
can do. You’ll wish you had a machine like mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
when you see how it works. You’re jealous, that’s
all. You’re mad because you haven’t got an airship.”</p>

<p>“Sure we are, Noddy,” answered Bob with a
smile. “But we’re going to have one.”</p>

<p>Bob’s companions looked at him in some wonder.</p>

<p>“We’re going to make one with our motor boat
that was smashed, and use some old auto tires,
filled with gas, to raise us. Then we’ll have a
race with your <i>Firefly</i>,” went on Bob with a cheerful
grin. “Ta-ta! Here’s your hat, what’s your
hurry?” and he slumped down on the grass, selecting
the most shady spot he could find, for it was
quite hot, and the sun was strong.</p>

<p>“That’s all right&mdash;I’ll show you,” murmured
Noddy as he turned away.</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed Jerry, when the bully had
passed out of sight. “Talk about trolley cars and
you’ll hear the fare register. But say, fellows, this
airship business has set me to thinking. We’ll have
to take in the carnival.”</p>

<p>“We sure will,” agreed Ned. “Let’s go and see
that poster Bob was talking about.”</p>

<p>“It’s too hot,” declared Bob. “I can tell you
all that’s on it. Besides, the fellow who was putting
it up gave me some circulars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you say so at first?” demanded
Jerry. “Pass ’em over and I’ll take a
squint at ’em.”</p>

<p>Bob pulled some papers from his pocket and
handed them over to Ned and Jerry, who were soon
deeply interested in the somewhat extravagant
statements advertising the carnival.</p>

<p>While they are thus engaged it will be a good
opportunity to tell you a little something about
them, where they lived and how they came to be
known as the “motor boys.”</p>

<p>Bob Baker was the son of Andrew Baker, a
wealthy banker, while Ned Slade’s father kept the
largest department store in Cresville, and was
counted well off. Jerry was the only son of Mrs.
Julia Hopkins, a widow, and she had a comfortable
income from wise investments made by her
husband.</p>

<p>The three boys, who lived in the New England
town of Cresville, not far from Boston, had been
chums as long as they could remember.</p>

<p>Their early adventures were told of in the
first book of this series, entitled “The Motor
Boys.”</p>

<p>They gained the name from the fact that they
took part in bicycle races, one of them winning a
motor cycle. Later all three acquired those speedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
machines, and it was not long before they owned an
automobile.</p>

<p>In that they made a long trip overland, and later
went into Mexico, where, in company with Professor
Uriah Snodgrass, a noted scientist, engaged
in making a collection of curious bugs and animals,
they discovered a buried city. They returned home
from Mexico across the plains, and, shortly after
that, using some of the funds from their interest
in a gold mine they discovered, they purchased a
motor boat.</p>

<p>In that boat, named the <i>Dartaway</i>, they had
stirring times, as told in the fifth volume of this
series, entitled “The Motor Boys Afloat.” Following
their adventures around home they made a long
trip on the Atlantic, and from there they went
into the strange waters of the Florida everglades.
Their experiences there were fully equaled by a
trip they next made on the Pacific, searching for a
mysterious derelict, though they had to make this
voyage in a motor boat they hired by the season,
as their own was smashed in a railroad wreck as
it was being sent home from Florida.</p>

<p>They had returned from California in time to
resume their studies at the Cresville Academy, and
they had put in a full winter at their books. They
had just successfully passed their examinations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and when this story opens, early in July, were still
undecided what to do during the long vacation.</p>

<p>It was while Ned was paying a visit to Jerry,
under the trees near that lad’s house, that Bob
came along with the news of the carnival, with what
result you have just been made acquainted.</p>

<p>The boys eagerly perused the hand-bills and
circulars which Bob gave them. Even Andy Rush
was so interested that he forgot to talk, which was
the occupation the little fellow was at most of the
time, when he was not asleep or eating.</p>

<p>“Well, what about it, fellows?” asked Bob, as
he saw Ned and Jerry thoughtfully folding up the
circulars.</p>

<p>“It’s great,” was Jerry’s comment. “We’ve got
to take it in, Ned.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say. We were just wishing
we had something to do, and along comes
Chunky&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew you’d be interested as soon as I
saw that poster,” interrupted the stout lad.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad that we let Noddy get ahead of us,
though,” continued Jerry.</p>

<p>“Can’t we make some kind of an airship?”
asked Bob. “All it needs is some wings and a
motor. We can take the one from the auto. It’s
almost new, and it has six cylinders,” for they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had a new engine put in their car, and the machine
had otherwise been brought up to date.</p>

<p>“I guess it needs more than an engine to make
a motor ship,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Motor ship! That’s a new one,” commented
Ned. “But it’s a good name. I wish we had a
motor ship.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we will have&mdash;some day,” remarked
Jerry with that serious, thoughtful look still on his
face. “But it’s too late to think of one for this
carnival. However, we can take the show in. We
may get some new ideas. Let’s see&mdash;to-day is
Tuesday. It opens next Monday. We’ll arrange
to go in our auto, and stay the whole week. Can
you fellows manage it?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Bob, who knew his parents
would not object.</p>

<p>“I’ll go along,” added Ned. “I was just wishing
we could have some kind of an outing. I was
thinking of Florida again.”</p>

<p>“And the Seabury girls, of course,” added
Jerry with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, I would like to see them. I guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I guess one would do you&mdash;Miss Olivia,” went
on Jerry. “How about it, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Aw, cut it out,” and Ned blushed.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s settled. We’ll go to the aero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
carnival,” declared Bob, fearful, perhaps, lest Jerry
should twit him about Miss Rose Seabury, one of
three sisters whose acquaintance they had made
while in Florida.</p>

<p>Little Andy Rush glanced from one to the other
of the three motor boys. There was a wistful
look on his face.</p>

<p>“Would you like to go along, Andy?” asked
Jerry, guessing the meaning of the small chap’s
gaze.</p>

<p>“Would I? Say&mdash;would I eat ice cream? Think
of it! Airships&mdash;above the clouds&mdash;balloons&mdash;motors
bang-bang! up in the air&mdash;down to the
ground&mdash;whoop de deedle-de! over the fence is
out&mdash;try again&mdash;blow up the gas bag&mdash;start over&mdash;there
they go&mdash;a race in the sky&mdash;O la-la!
Whoop!”</p>

<p>“There, I guess you’d like to go, all right. Now
cool down, or you might crack a cylinder,” advised
Jerry. “Go ask your folks, Andy, and see
us later.”</p>

<p>Andy found that he could go, and the following
Saturday the three motor boys, with their small
guest, started from Cresville in their auto. They
intended to put up at a hotel in Broadlands, and
remain a week at the carnival.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>AMID THE AIRSHIPS</small></h2>


<p>“Say, it’s quite an affair, isn’t it?” said Jerry,
when, late that Saturday night, they rode past the
grounds where the airship exhibition was to take
place. The boys were on their way to the hotel,
where they had engaged rooms in advance, a necessary
precaution, as such a crowd flocked to Broadlands
that the accommodations of the place were
stretched to the utmost.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s going to be a first-rate show,” commented
Ned. “I thought it might be a fake from
the way the handbills read.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the real thing, all right,” declared
Bob. “An organization of wealthy men is back of
it, I heard dad say, and they’ve got some real good
machines here. They’re going to give prizes, too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any airships flying around,” objected
Andy, who, as Jerry halted the machine outside
of the grounds, was gazing anxiously aloft.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” replied Ned. “They aren’t
going to bring them out before the show opens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
I suppose all of them are not here yet. But there
are tents and sheds enough to house half a hundred.”</p>

<p>Certainly there were a number of big buildings
and tents on the grounds. The buildings were of
the flimsiest character, but were all that were
needed to shelter dirigible balloons or aeroplanes.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Noddy’s <i>Firefly</i> is?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Did he ship it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he sent it off, all right,” answered
Jerry. “I was asking Mr. Hitter, the freight agent
at the depot, about it. He said Noddy fussed and
fretted for fear it would get broken on the road.
It was all taken apart and boxed up, and Noddy
threatened to sue the railroad if one piece of his
machine was lost or damaged. Mr. Hitter said
he nearly bothered the life out of him.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see it,” said Ned. “I wonder which
tent or shed is his?”</p>

<p>“We’ll inquire later,” said Jerry. “But first
we’d better get to the hotel and see about our
rooms. There’s such a crowd here they may not
reserve them for us if we don’t claim them soon.”</p>

<p>Indeed, they did not arrive at the hotel any too
quickly, for the clerk was about to ignore the reservation
they had telegraphed for, and give their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
rooms to newcomers. The boys, however, secured
two nice, large ones, and were soon installed in
them with their suitcases, which held their clothing.</p>

<p>“Let’s go out to the grounds,” proposed Bob,
when they had unpacked and enjoyed a good wash,
to remove some of the grime and dust of their
auto trip.</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” said Jerry. “We’ll see if we
can spot Noddy’s <i>Firefly</i>.”</p>

<p>The four boys got into the auto and were soon
at the carnival grounds. The place was open, as
it was necessary to have such a large field, for the
operations of the balloons and aeroplanes, that it
would have been impossible to enclose it with a
fence. But though the spectators could freely view
the ships of the air when they were in flight, they
were prevented from noting them at rest, as every
one was under some tent or housed in a temporary
building.</p>

<p>The place was somewhat in confusion, as new
exhibits were constantly arriving; stand owners,
who hoped to sell refreshments, were engaged in
putting up the booths; and men with big trucks
were driving here and there, with immense boxes
on their vehicles.</p>

<p>These last were, evidently, parts of airships and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
were to be assembled under one of the many tents
or other structures that dotted the ground.</p>

<p>Here and there could be seen nervous men, who
were anxious for the fate of some weird machine
that a careless truckman had agreed to deliver.
One such man was admonishing the driver of a
big wagon, on which was a large case.</p>

<p>“Now be very careful of that&mdash;very careful,”
the owner was saying. “The least jar will displace
some of the delicate springs, and shift the center of
gravity, besides disturbing the equilibrium of the
centrifugal planes. Careful, now&mdash;look out!”</p>

<p>The ground was uneven, and, in driving, the
truckman reined his horses into a hollow. The
vehicle careened, and the big case was on the
verge of falling off.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Catch it! Quick! It will be
smashed! The work of ten years will be ruined!”
cried the inventor.</p>

<p>He was walking alongside the truck, and he tried
to hold the case from sliding off the inclined platform
by bracing his hands against it. But it was
too heavy for him and continued to move toward
the ground.</p>

<p>“Let’s help him,” suggested Jerry, and with one
accord the boys jumped from the auto, which Jerry
had stopped, and ran to the aid of the man. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
managed to stop the case from sliding off, and by
that time the driver had urged his horses to a level
place.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to thank you!” exclaimed the
inventor to Andy and the motor boys. “If that
case had fallen to the ground my airship would
have been smashed. I am a thousand times obliged
to you. That is my tent over there. Now, be very
careful, truckman.”</p>

<p>“Aw, sure I’ll be careful. But I never see such
uneven ground. What sort of an airship is it,
anyhow, if a little fall like that will smash it?
Sure, what’ll yez do when ye falls from the sky?
Answer me that.”</p>

<p>Clearly he was not a firm believer in the future
of airships.</p>

<p>“A fall, no matter from what height, will not
matter when my ship is in operation, for the centrifugal
planes and the equalizing balances will
render any descent harmless,” declared the inventor.
“Now, continue on, Mr. Truckman, if you
please. I am very much obliged to you young
gentlemen. Are you exhibiting here? If so I may
have a race in the air with you.”</p>

<p>“No, we’re only here out of curiosity,” answered
Jerry. “But we are very much interested in airships.
What kind is yours?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, that’s a great secret,” replied the inventor
with a sly look. “I can’t tell you. But I will astonish
the crowds Monday by making the most
successful flight. I don’t mind admitting that my
machine is built on the principle of the flying grasshopper.
It acquires a start by means of two long
shafts, made on the model of the hind legs of a
grasshopper. By means of powerful springs my
machine is launched into the air, just as a grasshopper
leaps forward. Then his wings sustain him,
just as the wings, the centrifugal planes and the
equalizing weights, will hold up my airship with
me on it. I have a great invention. I must go
now and put it together. I hope it is not damaged.
It is a great risk to bring it here, but I expect to
win the grand prize.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about any other airships
that are here?” inquired Ned as the boys started
back to their auto.</p>

<p>“Not much. Why?”</p>

<p>“A fellow from our town has one here. He is
Noddy Nixon, and he calls his machine the <i>Firefly</i>.
We wanted to see it.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Firefly</i>? Oh, yes, I know about it. Young
Nixon was telling me about it. He is a smart
youth, but his machine will never fly.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we think,” declared Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, it will never fly,” went on the inventor of
the machine built on the plan of a grasshopper.
“He has the wrong idea. The wings of his fly are
not large enough, and are too heavy. But my
machine will work. I am positive of it. Come
and see me after my first flight, and I may let you
go up. Just ask for Morris Abernot. I will be
in this tent here,” and he indicated one toward
which the truck was slowly being driven.</p>

<p>“Do you know where the <i>Firefly</i> is kept?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes. Right over in that tent with the yellow
flag,” and Mr. Abernot pointed to a canvas shelter
some distance away.</p>

<p>“Let’s go over, fellows,” proposed Jerry. “I’d
like to see what Noddy really has.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll make trouble,” suggested Bob.
“He’s mad at us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s always that way,” put in Ned. “That’s
nothing new. I’d like to see the <i>Firefly</i>, too.
Maybe he isn’t there, and we can peep into the
tent.”</p>

<p>“More likely he’s charging admission to see his
freak,” was Jerry’s comment. “That’s what some
of these fake inventors are doing. They know
their machines will never leave the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
their only chance to make money is to charge admission.
I’ll bet that’s what Noddy is doing.”</p>

<p>They went over to the tent with the yellow flag,
threading their way in the auto between rows of
booths and new buildings. When they got near
enough they saw that the yellow flag bore the
initials “N. N.” for Noddy Nixon.</p>

<p>“He’s doing the thing up in style,” remarked
Bob. “Let’s get out of the car and walk over.
It’s too rough riding here.”</p>

<p>They approached the large tent where the <i>Firefly</i>
was kept. About it was a curious throng, as,
indeed, there was about every place where an airship
was housed. On the front of the tent was a
large sign reading:</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Nixon’s Wonderful Firefly Airship.<br />
None Like It.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admission 25 Cents</span>.</p>

<p>“Let’s go in,” said Jerry. “I’ve got change. I
want to see what Noddy is capable of.”</p>

<p>“He’s got nerve, asking a quarter,” commented
Bob. “Most of the places only charge ten cents.”</p>

<p>“‘None like it,’” remarked Ned. “I guess
that’s true, all right, unless it’s Professor Abernot’s
grasshopper. Well, let’s go in.”</p>

<p>They started for the entrance to the tent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
purchased four tickets of the man who stood at
the flap. Something about the fellow attracted
Jerry’s attention as he paid over the money.</p>

<p>“It’s Bill Berry,” he whispered to his chums.
“I know him, even if he’s shaved off his moustache.
I haven’t seen him since he tried to wreck the
steamer. I wonder how he dare come around
here?”</p>

<p>“Maybe the government has given up trying to
prosecute him for changing the lanterns in the
lighthouse,” suggested Bob. “He’s in with Noddy
again, that’s evident. Well, they’re a fine team.”</p>

<p>Bill Berry was a town ne’er-do-well, who more
than once had aided Noddy in his schemes to make
trouble for the motor boys. But this time Bill, if
indeed it was he at the tent flap, seemed to think
the boys would not recognize him, for he betrayed
no uneasiness.</p>

<p>The four lads passed into the tent, another man
being stationed just inside the entrance to take up
their tickets. They handed him the pasteboard
slips, and had just taken a glimpse of a curious
machine in the center of the canvas enclosure, when
they saw Noddy Nixon rushing toward them.</p>

<p>“Get out of here!” cried the bully. “I don’t
want you in my tent! You can’t come here and
make fun of my invention!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“We paid for our admission,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if you did! I’m not going to let
you in! Get out!”</p>

<p>Noddy drew back his fist to strike Jerry, while
the other boys crowded up closer.</p>

<small>THE FAT MAN’S WAGER</small></h2>


<p>For a moment, following Noddy’s excited announcement,
it looked as if there would be a fight.
The bully was very angry, and he probably thought
that the motor boys had come into his tent to
make fun of him.</p>

<p>“Are you going to get out?” he cried, as Jerry
showed no signs of withdrawing, and the other
three lads stood their ground.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll make you. Bill&mdash;Bill&mdash;come in here
and help me put them out!”</p>

<p>“That was Bill Berry outside,” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>A second later Bill came running in.</p>

<p>“Put Jerry Hopkins and his gang out! I don’t
want them here,” said Noddy.</p>

<p>“How are you, Bill? Wrecked any more steamers
lately?” asked Jerry quickly, and Bill, who must
have fancied that disguising himself by shaving off
his moustache was not sufficient, decided that it
was better to retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get out of here! Clear out!” ordered Noddy,
suddenly rushing at the four boys. They did not
attempt to strike him, and Noddy knew better
than to run the risk of hostilities by delivering any
blows. He only pushed and shoved, and, as he was
one against four, he was not succeeding very well.</p>

<p>Suddenly Noddy slipped and stumbled, bumping
up against a fat woman who just then had entered
the tent. She screamed, and there was some confusion
in the place, which contained quite a few
people.</p>

<p>A man pushed his way through the throng that
was gathered about the entrance, some trying to
get out of the way of impending trouble, and others
seeking to come in. The man wore a badge on
his coat.</p>

<p>“What’s the row?” he asked quickly. “What’s
the excitement about?”</p>

<p>“We came in to view this machine, paying our
way,” said Jerry, for he noticed that the man’s
badge indicated that he was a member of the aero
carnival committee. “The owner of the <i>Firefly</i>,
Noddy Nixon, refuses to let us see it, after we have
paid our money.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the committee member
sternly. “He won’t let you see it? None of that,
young man! When you are given an exhibition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
space on this ground you have to conform to all
the rules of the association. Any one who pays
admission is entitled to see any machine on the
grounds. You can’t do any crooked work like
that or we’ll order you off. This is a genuine
exhibition.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ll make fun of me&mdash;they’re enemies
of mine, and I don’t want ’em here,” whined
Noddy.</p>

<p>“That makes no difference. You’ll not be the
first inventor who was laughed at&mdash;especially those
who build airships. If you can’t stand being made
fun of you’ve no business to go into this carnival.
Now let me hear of no more disturbances in your
tent, or I’ll close you up. Of course, you boys
can stay. The idea of him trying to prevent you!”
and the man looked at Noddy in disgust as he
withdrew.</p>

<p>Much crestfallen, Noddy walked into a
smaller tent erected within the larger one, and
there he nursed his wrath, while Jerry and his
chums walked about viewing the <i>Firefly</i> from
various sides.</p>

<p>It was a curious machine. There was a metal
body or car, about as large as a good-sized clothes
basket. This contained a seat for the operator
and the motor for working the big wings. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
latter were made of sheets of tin, riveted to long
skeleton frames of iron. The wings, of which
there were four, two on a side, were shaped like
those of a butterfly. They worked up and down
by means of wheels and pistons, operated by the
gasolene motor.</p>

<p>There was a tail in the rear, set like that on a
fish, and it could be moved from side to side, presumably
to steer the machine, by means of cords,
levers and pulleys. The whole affair looked quite
heavy, for it was all made of metal. Too heavy,
indeed, to fly, as many observers commented, yet
from what Noddy had said he evidently expected
to make it sail through the air, carrying himself
or some other venturesome person.</p>

<p>That the <i>Firefly</i> was not destined for long
flights was evident from the contracted space of
the car. There was barely room for the operator
and the motor, and no supplies for a long trip
could be carried.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Jerry, when he and his chums
had spent some time examining the metal “fly,”
during which interim Noddy had not shown himself,
“well, that’s a queer arrangement, sure
enough. I want to see it in motion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll see it, all right,” declared a young
man, whom Noddy had evidently hired to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
him. “Professor Nixon will make his first flight
Monday, the opening of the carnival. Professor
Nixon will challenge all the other inventors to a
race.”</p>

<p>“Get on to that, would you?” whispered Ned
to Bob. “‘Professor Nixon!’ Why doesn’t he
change his name?”</p>

<p>“We’ll be here to see him fly on Monday,”
added Jerry. “Come on, fellows; I guess we’ve
seen enough now.”</p>

<p>They left the tent, looking curiously as they
went out for a sign of Bill Berry. But that individual
had evidently gone into hiding, and he was
replaced by another unprepossessing chap, who was
selling tickets.</p>

<p>It was getting dusk now, and the crowds that
had gathered to see the carnival put in shape and
the exhibits arranged were beginning to leave.</p>

<p>The boys went back to their hotel, and the next
day they took a pleasant auto ride in the suburbs
of Broadlands, which was quite a large city. They
passed the carnival grounds, and saw that there
was little activity on them, few of the exhibitors
caring to do any more than was necessary on
Sunday.</p>

<p>“They’ll not be in very good shape by to-morrow,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
commented Ned. “Half the things haven’t
arrived yet, the hotel man told me.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s always the way with these affairs,”
said Jerry. “About the end of the week things
will be in better shape. But we’ll have a good
time, and we may get some ideas that will be of
value to us.”</p>

<p>“Why, do you expect to have an airship?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“We might,” answered Jerry slowly. “I don’t
see why we couldn’t have one. We made out all
right with our auto and our motor boat. What’s
the matter with having a motor ship next?”</p>

<p>“Wait until we see how Noddy succeeds,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m anxious to see him fly, though I know
he’ll never do it in that contraption,” declared
Jerry.</p>

<p>The carnival was formally opened the next afternoon,
though, as usual with such affairs, not half
the exhibits were in place. But addresses were
made, the history of aeronautics was rehearsed by
several speakers, others made great predictions for
the future, and then it was announced by the chairman
of the committee in charge that some of the
inventors would try out their apparatus.</p>

<p>“One of the first to make an attempt to fly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
this carnival will be Professor Nixon,” went on the
chairman. “In his machine, which he calls the
<i>Firefly</i>, he will endeavor, so he tells me, to make
a complete circuit of the grounds. If you will
kindly give your attention to the tent over which is
flying the yellow flag you will soon see Professor
Nixon and his airship.”</p>

<p>The crowd, including the four boys from Cresville,
hurried over to Noddy’s tent. Now, if
Noddy was at all bashful, or fearful that his machine
would not work, he did not show it. The
front of the tent was pulled to one side, and the
curious <i>Firefly</i> was revealed. Many thus saw it
for the first time.</p>

<p>“Professor Nixon asked me to announce that
this machine is entirely his own invention,” went
on the chairman, “though he was obliged to hire
the most of the work done in a machine shop.
He will now fly for us.”</p>

<p>“As long as he doesn’t fly toward us it’ll be all
right, Professor,” said a tall man in the crowd. “I
wouldn’t want that to fall on me. It must weigh
several tons.”</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this.</p>

<p>“That’ll never fly,” was another comment.</p>

<p>“That’s a submarine&mdash;that ain’t an airship,”
jeered a third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let her go, Professor,” called a boy. “Better
get a feather bed to fall on, though. When you
come down you’ll come down hard.”</p>

<p>“You people can make all the fun you want,”
shouted Noddy, as he and some men he had hired
began to wheel the <i>Firefly</i> out of the tent. “But
you’ll soon see something that will astonish you.”</p>

<p>The flying machine was wheeled out into the
open. It rested on a small truck, and Noddy presently
busied himself about the motor.</p>

<p>“Go borrow a balloon somewhere, and maybe
you’ll go up,” was a suggestion from a red-haired
man.</p>

<p>“You mind your own business!” fired back
Noddy.</p>

<p>A fat man waddled through the crowd until
he stood in the front rank, close to the machine.
The four boys were near him.</p>

<p>“Is that the <i>Firefly</i>?” the fat man asked of no
one in particular.</p>

<p>“That’s what it is. It’s my machine,” replied
Noddy proudly.</p>

<p>“What’s it for&mdash;plowing?”</p>

<p>“Plowing! This is an airship,” answered
Noddy indignantly.</p>

<p>“An airship! Good land, that’ll never rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
one inch off the earth. It’s too heavy,” declared
the fat man.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is, eh?” asked Noddy. “Maybe you
know a lot about airships?”</p>

<p>“I do,” replied the man quietly. “I’ve made
more than a hundred balloon ascensions, and I
tell you that your machine will never fly. What’s
to make it go up?”</p>

<p>“What makes a fly go up? The wings, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the fat man.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you and all the rest of these knockers!”
boasted Noddy.</p>

<p>“Not in a thousand years, the way you’ve got it
built,” cried the fat man very earnestly. “Look
here; I’ll wager you a hundred dollars that you
don’t fly with it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you up!” retorted Noddy, pulling a
big roll of bills from his pocket. “I’m going to
fly in about ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“That’s a go!” declared the fat person, pulling
some money from his pocket in turn. “Here, will
you hold this?” he asked a man next to him, and
the man accepted the wager.</p>

<p>“I’ve made a hundred dollars easy,” commented
the fleshy one to those near him. “He’ll never fly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” asserted Noddy. “You watch
me.”</p>

<p>He continued tinkering with his motor, and at
last announced that he was ready.</p>

<p>“Clear the track!” cried some of his helpers.
“He has to have a long start. Clear the track!
Professor Nixon is going to fly in his wonderful
invention.”</p>

<p>“He’s going to fly toward the ground like a
chunk of lead,” said the fat man with a laugh.</p>

<p>“All ready?” asked Noddy to his principal assistant.</p>

<p>“All ready, Professor.”</p>

<p>“Let her go!” cried Noddy, cranking the motor,
which soon began to make a noise like a Gatling
gun.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>A DISASTROUS FLIGHT</small></h2>


<p>“Hold on there! Hold on!” cried the fat man,
as Noddy was about to pull some levers, which,
presumably, set the gears in mesh and would make
the big tin wings flap, though they were motionless
now.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Noddy angrily,
looking up.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to wager me a hundred
dollars that you could fly in that thing?”</p>

<p>“So I am.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you put up the money? Mine’s
up.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’m good for it,” murmured Noddy.
“The bet stands. Look out, there, I’m going to
make a start now! Clear the way! Look out!
Look out everybody!”</p>

<p>He turned a little more gasolene into the motor,
and the apparatus banged away louder than ever.
The whole machine vibrated.</p>

<p>But something seemed to be the matter. Noddy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
who had taken his seat in the small car attached
to the machine, was vainly pulling on levers and
twisting wheels.</p>

<p>“Something’s stuck,” he said.</p>

<p>“You’re stuck,” replied the fat man. “You’re
stuck for a hundred dollars; that’s who’s stuck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let up!” exclaimed Noddy as the fat man
began to laugh. “Just you wait!”</p>

<p>“We are waiting,” cried several in the crowd.
“Let her go, Professor Nixon.”</p>

<p>“Bring us down one of those clouds,” suggested
another.</p>

<p>“Yes, and a little cooler atmosphere from
above,” added a third waggish one.</p>

<p>Noddy was red in the face from his exertions in
yanking on various levers. He could not seem to
get the motor in gear, though the machine was
working away at a fast rate. Finally Noddy called
to one of his helpers. The man, who was evidently
a machinist, soon located the trouble.</p>

<p>“I told you to pull out that catch before you
tried to work the starting lever,” he said.</p>

<p>“Guess he doesn’t know much about the machine,”
was the fat man’s comment.</p>

<p>“I know more than you, and I’ll show you so
in a minute, too,” declared Noddy savagely.</p>

<p>He pulled on a lever with all his force. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was a grinding of cog-wheels, a sort of cough and
wheeze from the motor as it took up the load, and
then the big wings began to vibrate slowly up and
down.</p>

<p>“There she goes!” cried the crowd in some enthusiasm.
“Hurrah! He’s off!”</p>

<p>“Well, the wings move, that’s sure,” admitted
Jerry to his chums, “but it’s another thing to rise
in the air.”</p>

<p>Noddy, however, had not yet turned on full
power. He did so a moment later, and the motor
seemed to redouble the explosions, which, not being
muffled, made a terrific din. The wings went up
and down faster than ever, so rapidly, in fact, that
they looked only like a bright blur.</p>

<p>Then Noddy pulled a rope, which shifted a
sort of box-kite arrangement that was mounted on
supports above the wings, and, to the surprise of
the motor boys and the others in the crowd, the
clumsy-looking tin fly began to move forward,
slowly at first, but, gathering speed, it skimmed
over the ground, moving along on the wheels of the
platform on which it rested.</p>

<p>“There he goes! There he goes!” cried the
throng. “He’s going to fly!”</p>

<p>“Not yet, but soon, maybe,” murmured Ned.
“Come on, fellows, let’s run after him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>They hastened forward, following the crowd
which was all about the curious machine.</p>

<p>“Keep back! Give me room! Don’t get in the
way! Some one may get hurt! Stand back! Keep
back!” yelled Noddy, who was much excited.</p>

<p>He turned on more gasolene. The motor was
now working so fast that the whole machine
seemed ready to fly apart with the violence of the
explosions and the vibrations of the tin wings.</p>

<p>“Here I go!” yelled Noddy.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d gone some time ago,” remarked
the fat man sarcastically. He was puffing
and wheezing, as he ran to keep up with the machine.
Noddy did not reply. He pulled on another
lever, and then something did happen.</p>

<p>The <i>Firefly</i> lifted itself off the wheeled platform
and fairly lurched forward, rising the least
bit into the air, which action was necessary before
it could leave the platform.</p>

<p>“Look out! Look out!” cried many voices, and
the crowd in front of the curious affair ducked and
dodged, separating so as to allow a clear passage
for the tin fly.</p>

<p>With the motor firing a regular volley of explosions,
and Noddy sitting desperately in his narrow
seat, the <i>Firefly</i> dashed forward. But if the
crowd expected it to sail aloft over their heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
they were much disappointed. It continued to lurch
forward, and then, whether Noddy pulled the
wrong lever or cord, or whether it was the nature
of the contrivance, was never clearly established,
but it turned squarely about and started back.</p>

<p>“It’s afraid! It’s scared at the crowd!” yelled
the fat man, who seemed delighted at Noddy’s
discomfiture.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shouted the now excited throng,
as the people separated to give the <i>Firefly</i> room
to do all the queer stunts it desired.</p>

<p>Noddy was now holding on to the framework
about him. He seemed to have given up trying
to guide the airship, which was more of a “ground
ship,” for it was now resting upon the earth, and
hopping forward, by uncertain jerks, like a tired
frog.</p>

<p>“Go up! Go up! Why don’t you go up?”
panted the fleshy one. “I’m going to win my hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p>Noddy reached forward to pull another lever.
As he did so the <i>Firefly</i> swerved to one side, narrowly
missing knocking over several persons who
had approached too close. Then it swung back
again, and next began to hop over the ground in
real earnest, the flapping of the broad wings, every
time they went up and down, serving to lift it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
jerks. But as for flying, one might as well expect
a man to lift himself by his own boot-straps.</p>

<p>Straight ahead flopped the <i>Firefly</i>, right toward
a candy and lemonade stand, which the proprietor
had piled high with good things, in anticipation
of a brisk trade. The tin wings beat the air, the
motor exploded loudly, and the whole affair swayed
and trembled.</p>

<p>“Get a balloon!” yelled some one in the
crowd.</p>

<p>The owner of the stand, who had been too busy
fixing up his place to pay much attention to the
airship trials, now looked up. He saw coming
toward him the tin fly, and he realized his danger
and the danger to his stand.</p>

<p>“Here! Here!” he yelled. “Hold on! Stop
her! You’ll run into me! Stop it, I say!”</p>

<p>“Move your stand! This is the <i>Firefly</i> limited,
and it mustn’t get off the track,” said the fat man
with a laugh.</p>

<p>Noddy was doing his best to stop the motor, but
either he did not pull the right lever, or else the
machine had become jammed and could not be
stopped. It seemed bent on destroying the stand.</p>

<p>“Jump! jump!” cried several to Noddy, as they
saw that he was in danger. He stood up, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
his legs became tangled in some things in the bottom
of the car, and he could not extricate himself.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I can’t jump!” he shouted back.</p>

<p>“Shut off the motor!” yelled his machinist, pushing
his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>“I can’t do that either. Something’s the matter
with it! It won’t stop!”</p>

<p>The <i>Firefly</i> was approaching nearer and nearer
to the lemonade stand. The proprietor was frantically
jumping up and down in front of his possessions,
as if he could thus ward off the attack
of the airship.</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop, I tell you!” he shouted, shaking
his fist at the <i>Firefly</i>, which every second was coming
nearer.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled the crowd. “She’s going
to hit!”</p>

<p>And hit she did a moment later. At the last
moment Noddy managed to leap, and he did so
only just in time, for <a href="#image02">there was a resounding crash</a>,
a rending and splintering of wood. The lemonade
and candy stand seemed to crumple up. One side
gave way to admit the pointed prow of the <i>Firefly</i>,
then the stand seemed to swallow up the airship.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_45">“THERE WAS A RESOUNDING CRASH!”</a></div>
</div>

<p>All at once there flew in all directions packages
of candy, popcorn and boxes of other confections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
One pail of pink lemonade was tossed high into the
air, and, turning over, poured out a crimson flood,
which sprinkled the bystanders. Bottles of root-beer
and ginger ale mingled with sarsparilla in
forming a shower of cooling drinks. There was
a hail of peanuts.</p>

<p>The big tin wings, hampered in their movements
by the wreck of the stand, came to a stop.
But the motor went on. It was now running at full
speed, free, and its momentum was terrific. There
came several explosions, louder than any that had
preceded.</p>

<p>“Look out! She’s going to blow up! The gasolene
tank will explode!” cried the fat man.</p>

<p>The crowd, which had gathered about the wreck,
scattered on the run.</p>

<p>Once more came a loud explosion.</p>

<p>“There she goes!” yelled several.</p>

<p>But there followed only a whistle, a wheeze,
and a sort of apologetic cough from the motor.
Then, with a gentle sigh, the overworked machine
“went dead” and stopped. But oh what a scene
of wreck, ruin and desolation!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>NODDY IN A ROW</small></h2>


<p>Following the noise of the swiftly-running
motor, the shouts of the crowd and the crash as the
lemonade stand was demolished, there came a
period of silence. No one seemed to know what
to do or say.</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums watched Noddy pick himself
up from a pile of soft dirt, where he had
leaped just before his tin fly crashed into the stand.
The bully was a sorry-looking sight, his clothes
being thickly encrusted with soil, and his hands and
face grimy. He staggered forward and gazed at
the wreck.</p>

<p>“Well, it didn’t fly, and I knew it wouldn’t,”
observed the fat man. “I told you it was too
heavy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;don’t speak to me!” exclaimed Noddy
wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak to you! Well, I like that! I
guess I will speak to you long enough to ask you
for my hundred dollars. I won it on a fair wager,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and I want it. Here,” he said to the man who had
held his share of the bet, “give me my money. I’m
entitled to his, ain’t I?”</p>

<p>“You sure are,” said several in the crowd who
had heard the bargain Noddy had made.</p>

<p>“I wish I’d made him put his money up,” went
on the fat man. “Come on now, Professor Nixon,
or whatever your name is, fork over that hundred
dollars. It will come in handy for me. That
thing fly! It’ll never fly in a hundred years!” and
he began to laugh, which further nettled Noddy.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it fly yet!” said the bully, gritting his
teeth. “Something went wrong with the machinery.”</p>

<p>“I should say it did,” went on the fat man.</p>

<p>“It’ll need a lot of repairs before it will flop
its wings again,” observed Andy Rush, who was
in the front rank of spectators. Noddy heard him,
and turned savagely on the little chap.</p>

<p>“You mind your own business!” he exploded.
“If I catch you around my machine I’ll have you
arrested. I believe you sneaked in and monkeyed
with it so I couldn’t fly. I’ve a good notion to
punch your head.”</p>

<p>“Better not try it,” advised Jerry quietly. “And
you have no right to say Andy did anything to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
machine. He was nowhere near it, except when we
were with him.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you had a hand in it,” murmured
Noddy. “You’re jealous of me, that’s what you
are.”</p>

<p>“Here, you drop that kind of talk!” exclaimed
Jerry, striding forward. “We know you, Noddy
Nixon, and we know your crony, Bill Berry. If
you don’t keep a civil tongue in your head we’ll
see that you’re put out of this carnival. We never
touched your crazy tin fly, and we’re not jealous
of you. If we couldn’t get up a better airship than
that we wouldn’t have any.”</p>

<p>“That ship is all right. All it needs is a little
fixing,” went on Noddy, taking care to keep well
away from Jerry.</p>

<p>“Who owns this thing?” suddenly asked the
stand owner, as he came from a silent contemplation
of the wreck and ruin and approached the
crowd.</p>

<p>“He does!” exclaimed half a dozen persons,
pointing at Noddy.</p>

<p>“You did that on purpose! You know you did!
I saw you steering straight for my stand,” cried the
man. “I want damages now&mdash;heavy damages!
Everything is spoiled, and it cost me fifteen dollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to build the stand, besides all the things I had. I
must have damages.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” retorted Noddy, who had had
about all he could stand in the way of misfortune.</p>

<p>“‘Dry up,’ eh? I’ll show you!” cried the man.
“Are you going to pay me for my things?”</p>

<p>“It was an accident. I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“What difference does that make to me? That
won’t bring back my lemonade. That won’t wrap
up the popcorn in packages again. That won’t
mend the broken bottles of ginger ale. I want
damages, and I’m going to have ’em.”</p>

<p>The man was so insistent, and stood close to
Noddy in such a threatening manner, that the bully
was alarmed. He shrank back.</p>

<p>“It was an accident,” he repeated. “I couldn’t
help it. Something went wrong with the engine.
I’m&mdash;I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“A heap of good that does me!” cried the angry
stand owner. “I want my things, or I want pay
for ’em. I must have fifty dollars, or I’ll have
you arrested for malicious mischief. I saw you
steer your crazy machine right my way. You
could easily have flown above me, instead of landing
in my stand.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t fly&mdash;that was the trouble,” said
the fat man, chuckling. “He couldn’t fly. I guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
we’ll call what’s left of his machine the ‘flyless-fly,’
instead of the <i>Firefly</i>. Ha, ha! Ho, ho!”</p>

<p>“I’ll&mdash;I’ll&mdash;&mdash;” spluttered Noddy, but he did
not know what to say.</p>

<p>“Well, are you going to pay me damages?” demanded
the stand owner. “I want fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I haven’t any money here,” said Noddy.</p>

<p>“You haven’t any money? And yet you made
a wager with me for one hundred dollars!” cried
the fleshy individual. “I like your nerve! How
were you going to pay me, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think I’d lose,” explained Noddy. “I
thought I’d fly.”</p>

<p>“And where is my fifty dollars coming from?”
again demanded the stand owner. “I want it and
I’m going to have it. Here the carnival has
opened, and I can’t do any business until I get a
new stand. I ought to soak you a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“That’s right! Make him pay!” cried the
throng.</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Noddy angrily, “I
haven’t any money, and I can’t pay.”</p>

<p>“Then you had no right to make a wager with
me,” said the fat man. “I put up my money, and
you said you’d put up yours.”</p>

<p>“I want my fifty dollars!” was the burden of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the cry set up by the stand owner. “You’re a nice
one, to go smashing people’s property, and then
not pay! If it had been an automobile man he’d
pay me right off, but you airship fellers ain’t no
good.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me alone!” cried Noddy. “If any one
bothers me any more I’ll punch his head. Let me
get my machine out of that stand.”</p>

<p>“Not until you pay me my fifty dollars,” insisted
the lemonade man.</p>

<p>“And I ought to hold at least one wing as security
until I get my hundred,” put in the fat man.</p>

<p>Noddy was beside himself with rage. He
looked as if he wanted to fight the whole crowd.
There was a movement on one edge of the throng,
and a man pushed his way through.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Noddy?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. Nixon, Noddy’s father,” exclaimed
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I&mdash;I had a little accident,” explained
Noddy to his parent, who had just arrived on the
grounds, expecting to see his son sailing about in
an airship, for Noddy had boasted much of his
<i>Firefly</i>.</p>

<p>“An accident? I should say you did,” remarked
Mr. Nixon, who, though he usually took the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of his bullying son, could at least see such an
obvious happening as was spread all about.</p>

<p>“Yes, he busted my stand all to pieces, and I
want damages,” said the owner, seeing a possible
chance for reimbursement.</p>

<p>“And I’d like the hundred dollars I won from
him,” added the stout man.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chorused the crowd, as Mr.
Nixon looked at his son for confirmation of these
charges. “He made the bet and he smashed the
stand.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” murmured Mr. Nixon. “Very well, I
will settle for him. Where is your tent, Noddy?”</p>

<p>The owner of the wrecked <i>Firefly</i> pointed to the
canvas structure.</p>

<p>“Come over there,” went on Mr. Nixon to the
fat man and the stand owner, “and I will pay you.
Come, Noddy.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but my airship?”</p>

<p>“Let it go. It’s only junk now. You can take
the engine out later, and throw the rest on the
scrap pile.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nixon led his son away, and the crowd dispersed,
for it wanted to see the other sights. Thus
ended Noddy’s first attempt to navigate the air.
The accident was destined to have an effect on the
future of the motor boys, as you shall see.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>IN GREAT PERIL</small></h2>


<p>The carnival was now in full swing, though not
all the exhibits and flying machines had arrived.
There was plenty to attract attention beside the
airships, for there were several amusement enterprises
on the grounds, and the usual devices to catch
the dimes and nickels of the throng.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s take a look around. I guess we
saw all we wanted to of Noddy,” said Bob. “Are
there any more queer machines?”</p>

<p>“Plenty of them,” replied Jerry, “to judge by
the tents where they are charging admission.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take ’em in,” suggested Ned. “We want
to get all the ideas we can.”</p>

<p>“Why?” inquired Andy Rush. “Are you going
to build one?”</p>

<p>“Maybe&mdash;some day,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“So you’re getting the fever too, eh?” asked
Jerry with a smile. “Well, it’s not a bad idea. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
want to see the aeroplane trials. I’m interested
in them.”</p>

<p>“They’ll come off at ten o’clock,” said Bob,
looking at a program he had purchased. “We’ve
got an hour yet, and likely more, for they’ll never
start on time.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s look at some more of the freaks,”
suggested Jerry.</p>

<p>They found several odd machines housed in
tents, or hastily constructed buildings, where from
ten cents to a quarter was charged for viewing the
product of some inventive brain.</p>

<p>One machine was merely a double bicycle, with
a sort of roof overhead made of canvas, and a
motor attached, which revolved a two-bladed propeller
in front. Another was a sort of aeroplane
affair, with two propellers in the rear, and still
another was the one modeled after a flying grasshopper,
shown by Morris Abernot.</p>

<p>The boys noticed that, as a general thing, the
propeller or propellers of all the machines were
mounted in front, to pull the ships through the
air, instead of acting on a boat principle, and pushing
them. But, even with all the power that large
motors could impart to the blades, it was difficult
to see how some of the machines could rise from the
earth, so heavy were they.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys concluded, and they were not far
wrong, that the machines were merely the output
of some freakish brain, that was rather warped on
the side of air navigation. Some of the affairs
had one or more correct principles, but as for ever
being practical they were so far from it as to be
laughable.</p>

<p>Nor did the crowd hesitate to laugh whenever
it saw anything that seemed grotesque, for some
of the affairs were weird in the extreme. There
were machines built on the models of birds, fishes
and insects, which the inventors had doubtless
studied with a firm belief that they could successfully
imitate nature.</p>

<p>Probably some of the inventors knew their machines
would never leave the earth, but, having
gone to the expense of making them, they wanted
to get a little money back by charging for a sight
of them. And, very likely, the management of
the carnival knew that the machines would not
work, but probably reasoned that the crowd would
like to look at them and derive some fun from the
crude attempts to navigate the upper regions.</p>

<p>Certainly Noddy’s efforts furnished considerable
amusement, and not a little excitement.</p>

<p>It was about ten o’clock when, having made the
rounds of the “freaks,” as they called them, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
boys strolled toward the section devoted to the
aeroplanes. Not all of these machines had arrived
yet, but several were on hand, and it was announced
that at least one inventor would give his
a trial, preparatory to the races the next day, when
there were to be competitions for prizes.</p>

<p>“Let’s get good places to see,” proposed Bob.</p>

<p>“The starting platform would be the best place,”
said Jerry. “We can get up there for a quarter
each, and we’ll have a good view of how they start
and manage the planes.”</p>

<p>As is well known, aeroplanes need a sort of flying
start in order to become effective. They must
get some distance up into the air, like a kite, before
they can sustain themselves.</p>

<p>Some machines accomplish this by gliding forward
on wheels until they have enough momentum
to shoot upward on a plane of air, which catches
under the big wings, while others are launched
from a high platform or framework by means of
men pulling on a long rope, or by weights, springs
or similar devices.</p>

<p>At this carnival a high platform had been
erected, from which the aeroplanes could shoot off,
and once they were started the motor operating
the propellers was depended on to keep them in
motion, and so up in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The platform was made quite large, to accommodate
a crowd, and thither the boys went, getting
good places, as they were among the first comers.</p>

<p>“Say, we’ll get a fine view from up here,” declared
Bob as he gazed about.</p>

<p>“That’s right&mdash;see everything&mdash;watch the human
birds skim about&mdash;swoop this way and that&mdash;over
our heads&mdash;up to the clouds&mdash;out of sight&mdash;down
again&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Andy,” spoke Jerry. “Save your
wind; you’ll need it later.”</p>

<p>There were to have been tests of two aeroplanes,
but at the last minute one inventor sent word that
his motor was out of order, and he would have to
postpone his trial until the afternoon. There was
some disappointment and murmuring by the crowd,
but when the canvas front of a shed near the platform
opened and a curious machine was wheeled
into view, there were exclamations of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“They’re going to have some sort of a test,
anyhow,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>The aeroplane which was being wheeled toward
the platform was like many others which you boys
have either seen in pictures or actually observed.
It consisted of a structure like an immense box-kite,
canvas being stretched over a bamboo frame.
In front of the main part was a smaller box-kite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
arrangement, that could be tilted, so as to cause
the plane to shoot upward or downward. In the
rear was a triangular rudder, and in front, below
the device which governed the elevation, were two
wooden propellers, worked by a small gasolene
motor amidships. There was a sort of box in
which the operator could sit.</p>

<p>“This machine,” announced the chairman of the
arrangement committee, “is the invention of Professor
Dundlass&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Seems to me everybody around here is a professor,”
murmured Ned. “We’ll have to tack
some titles to our names, Professor Hopkins.”</p>

<p>“Listen to what he says,” counseled Jerry.</p>

<p>“He has made successful flights with it,” went
on the chairman, “and he will now attempt another.
He asks your indulgence, as in a test last
week he strained some of the guy wires and bent
the rudder, but he will do the best he can. Later
he will enter a race.”</p>

<p>“Seems as though there was always some excuse
for these airship men,” murmured Ned. “I guess
each wants to have something ready to spring on
the crowd in case his machine doesn’t work.”</p>

<p>But the boys were now too interested in what
was going on to indulge in much talk. They
watched the inventor and his men wheel the aeroplane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to the foot of the platform, and then, by
means of ropes and pulleys, it was hoisted up to
where there was a sort of inclined track, whence
it could glide off.</p>

<p>The machine looked as if it would work. Certainly
if a big box-kite can not only sustain itself
in the air but also support heavy flags, banners
and even dummy figures, as is often done, a machine
built on the same principle, only much larger,
ought to hold up a man and a small engine.</p>

<p>“This is more like it,” said Jerry when Professor
Dundlass was adjusting his motor. “It’s a
wonder Noddy didn’t try something like this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he wanted to be different,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, he was,” commented Ned dryly.</p>

<p>The aeroplane was now resting on its runners
upon the inclined track, which had been made very
slippery with soap and grease, as are the ways
when a ship is launched. Several men were detailed
to give it a push when the inventor was
ready to glide off.</p>

<p>But Professor Dundlass seemed in no hurry.
He moved slowly about, looking at wires here,
braces there, testing his propellers with his hand,
looking at the rudder and putting some more oil
on the motor.</p>

<p>“Oh, move the boat!” cried an impatient one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I go pretty soon quick now,” replied the inventor,
speaking with a German accent. “But
first I must be sure I am all rights. It iss no jokes
to fall down from der clouds.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed the throng in a chorus,
and thereafter no one urged him to hurry.</p>

<p>There was a big crowd down on the ground
around the platform, and as many on that elevated
place as could get upon it and still leave room for
the aeroplane. The structure was about sixty feet
high.</p>

<p>At last the professor announced that all was
in readiness. There was not a little nervous feeling
among those in the throng, for though some
had seen balloon ascensions, this was different&mdash;to
see a man trust himself to a machine that was
much heavier than air.</p>

<p>“Now, you had betterness stant from under ven
I start,” called the inventor to those directly in
front of the platform. “If I falls on you I might
hurt some of you.”</p>

<p>He seemed very cool, in spite of what was
evidently a dangerous undertaking that was before
him. There were some final instructions to
the men who were to shove the plane off, and then
the inventor, taking his seat in the little box-like
car, told one of his assistants to start the motor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
The long-bladed propellers began to whirl around
so rapidly that they looked like a yellow haze of
light, and the motor, from not being muffled, as
that would have made it too heavy, made a terrific
racket.</p>

<p>“Shove!” cried the professor suddenly, as he
yanked on a lever, and the ten men behind the
machine gave a vigorous push.</p>

<p>With a graceful motion, like some great, white-winged
bird sailing on a flight from the sky, the
aeroplane swooped from the platform. There
was a yell from the crowd, and those who, in their
enthusiasm, had gathered beneath where it now
was hovering over their heads, scrambled to get
out of the way, fearing it was falling down on
them.</p>

<p>But with a wide sweep, the plane began to
ascend. The air caught under the forward box-kite
arrangement, and the airship slid upward in
a long, graceful curve.</p>

<p>“He’s going up! He’s going up!” cried Jerry
in his enthusiasm. “This one works all right!”</p>

<p>“He’s higher than the platform now!” added
Ned, and this was so, for the man in the aeroplane
was now about seventy feet above the earth. The
speed of the motor increased, to judge by the more
rapidly recurring explosions, and then, with a shift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the rudder, the inventor changed the course
of his machine.</p>

<p>He was now gliding broadside to the platform,
and those upon it had an excellent view. There
was a great cheer to gladden the heart of the
professor.</p>

<p>Once more he shifted his course and made a
complete circle. Then he turned and sailed off,
directly away from the platform. When several
hundred yards off he turned again, and came
straight for it.</p>

<p>“He has it under good control,” remarked Ned.
He had spoken quietly, but so great was the
silence maintained by those watching the airship
in flight that his voice almost startled him.</p>

<p>“He’s going to make a landing,” observed
Jerry. “He’s coming right for the platform. I
wonder if he can come down safely. I should
think he’d rather land on the ground.”</p>

<p>They could see the inventor busy with various
wheels and levers. The device for changing the
elevation of the plane was lowered. On and on
came the big affair, right for the platform.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a powerful gust of wind,
which was most unexpected, as there had not been
so much of a breeze before that. Those watching
the aeroplane saw it tilt to one side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s going to turn over!” cried several.</p>

<p>Indeed, it did seem so, for it was gliding along
at an angle of forty-five degrees. The inventor
appeared to be in trouble, and was now clinging
with both hands to the sides of his little car.</p>

<p>There came a stronger puff of wind. The aeroplane
dived downward and then sailed upward,
as does a kite when the tail is not properly adjusted.
Then, with a swoop like some gigantic
eagle, hurling itself upon its prey, the aeroplane
dashed right toward the platform, which was now
thronged with people. The inventor had lost control
of it in the powerful wind that was now blowing.</p>

<p>“Look out! Here she comes!” was the general
cry.</p>

<p>There was a scramble on the part of the throng
to get to a place of safety, but there was no place
to go. The narrow flight of steps, more like a
ladder than anything else, leading from the ground
to the top of the platform, was jammed by those
seeking to escape.</p>

<p>“It’s going to land right here where we are!”
cried Andy Rush. “Let’s jump off!”</p>

<p>“Stand still!” shouted Jerry. “If you jump
you’ll be killed. Stand still! He may get control
of it again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>But it did not seem possible, though the inventor
was working frantically to change the course of his
plane, which was now almost upon the platform,
over which it appeared likely to sweep, and only
a few feet above it.</p>

<p>In another moment it seemed as if scores of
people would be either swept off the high place
and dashed to the ground, sixty feet below, or
would be hit by the aeroplane. The motor boys
and those about them were in great peril.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>THE DIRIGIBLE BALLOONS</small></h2>


<p>The platform, which was none too solidly built,
began to shake and tremble from the efforts of
those on it trying to find some means of escape.
They rushed about, pushing and shoving, endeavored
to reach the stairs, which were so choked and
jammed as to render passage down them impossible.</p>

<p><a href="#image01">The aeroplane was now within ten feet of the
platform</a>, and was only a few feet above it. It
had resumed a level keel, but the wind and its
momentum were urging it forward, since the man
in charge had stopped his motor and the propellers
no longer revolved.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” cried Andy.</p>

<p>“Stoop down! Stoop down!” shouted Jerry.
“It may pass over our heads.”</p>

<p>“It’s too low now to do that,” said Ned in a
low voice to Jerry. “I guess we’re in for it.”</p>

<p>The excitement was now at its height. Scores
were sliding and climbing down the crossed uprights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of the platform, getting their hands and
clothes full of splinters, but this they did not mind,
only so they escaped being swept from the dizzy
height.</p>

<p>But suddenly a new danger was presented. The
aeroplane dropped in its course and now seemed
about to strike the platform at a point below the
flooring on which the most of the throng still
stood or crouched. Coming on as it was at great
speed the airship would probably demolish the
frail support, causing the death and injury of
many.</p>

<p>Then, with the same suddenness that it had
sprung up, the freakish wind shifted and blew at
right angles to the course of the plane, and, catching
under the broad stretch of muslin and canvas,
swerved the ship to one side.</p>

<p>And it was only just in time, for as it rushed
past the tower and platform one of the edges of
the big box-kite arrangement brushed the guard
rail of the structure.</p>

<p>“We’re safe! We’re safe!” cried Andy Rush.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess there’s no more danger,” admitted
Jerry. “But no more of this for mine.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” echoed Ned.</p>

<p>Seeing that the danger was past, the crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
calmed down. They looked for the aeroplane and
saw it glide gently to the ground.</p>

<p>“Well, he made a good landing, anyhow,” remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>“As long as he didn’t land on us we’re all
right,” observed Ned. “My, but that was a close
shave! After this I’m going to watch the trials
from down below.”</p>

<p>From the standpoint of an aeroplanist the flight
was a great success, for the inventor had been in
the air for some time, and had covered considerable
space. Professor Dundlass did not appear much
put out on account of what had happened.</p>

<p>“It vos great! Vunderful!” he exclaimed as
the people gathered about him. “Ven I gets me
my motor fixed up a bit I dinks I vin der prize.
Oh, it vos a great flight.”</p>

<p>Owing to the very evident danger of allowing
spectators on the high platform orders were issued
soon afterward by the management that no persons,
except inventors and their helpers, were to
be allowed on it when the aeroplanes were sent
off.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve seen enough for one morning,”
remarked Ned, when they had reached the ground
and taken another look at the aeroplane. “Let’s
get some lunch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good idea,” declared Jerry. “Come on.”</p>

<p>There were several hastily-constructed restaurants
on the carnival grounds, some in wooden
buildings and some under tents. The boys voted
for a tent, and made their way toward a large
one. When they neared it Jerry heard a girl’s
voice exclaim:</p>

<p>“There are the motor boys!”</p>

<p>He turned to behold Mollie Horton, one of the
girls of Cresville, with whom he and his chums
were on friendly terms.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mollie!” called Jerry. “Come and
have lunch with us.”</p>

<p>“You’d better wait until you see who’s with
me,” she replied. “Perhaps you will wish to recall
your invitation. Alice Vines and Helen Gale are
right over here.”</p>

<p>“Bring them along,” invited Ned. “That’ll
be one apiece for us, and Andy can be chaperon.”</p>

<p>“One what apiece?” asked Bob, who was looking
at a man selling box-kites.</p>

<p>“Girls, of course, you chump. Don’t you want
a nice girl to take to dinner?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” replied Chunky, looking around. Mollie
motioned for Alice and Helen to join her, and soon
the merry party were seated at a table beneath a
cool tent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry ordered a substantial lunch, much to Bob’s
delight, and finished it off with plates of ice cream.</p>

<p>“What are you girls going to do this afternoon?”
asked Jerry as they left the table.</p>

<p>“Oh, just look about,” replied Alice. “We only
came on the noon train, and we haven’t seen anything
yet. Have you?”</p>

<p>“I should say we had,” replied Ned. “We saw
Noddy Nixon try to fly, and we saw a man try out
his aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“Did Noddy really fly?” asked Mollie.</p>

<p>“Well, not so’s you could notice it,” replied Ned
with grim humor, and the other boys laughed.</p>

<p>“There is going to be an exhibition of dirigible
balloons this afternoon,” announced Andy Rush,
consulting his program. “We ought to take that
in.”</p>

<p>“We sure will,” declared Jerry. “Now, what
will we do until it’s time for them?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go for a spin in the car and cool off after
dinner,” proposed Bob, and his idea was voted a
good one. There was room, with a little squeezing,
for all of them, and they went out in the
suburbs for several miles, returning in time to
see several big balloons in process of inflation.</p>

<p>Hydrogen gas, manufactured on the grounds
by means of sulphuric acid and iron filings, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the lifting power of the balloons. There were
several of them, built in different shapes and sizes,
but on the same principle.</p>

<p>That is, they depended on the lifting power of
the gas to get them up in the air. Once elevated
there were motors, working propeller blades, to
send them along, a box-kite arrangement for slanting
up higher or descending, and a rudder to steer
to right or left. These attachments were contained
in a light framework car, which was fastened
to the gas bag by means of a network of cords.
All the gas bags were cigar-shaped, none of the
old-fashioned globular ones being used.</p>

<p>“This will be worth watching,” prophesied
Jerry. “There will be no danger to us, and we
can see several in the air at once. There’ll probably
be a race. Let’s get a place where there isn’t
such a crowd.”</p>

<p>They moved off to one side, where they could
get a good view. There were four dirigible balloons
in process of inflation. Slowly the oiled
silk gas containers filled, as the light hydrogen
vapor poured into them. Men were busy about
them, straightening out the cords, attaching bags
of ballast or adjusting the motors.</p>

<p>The wind had died out to a gentle breeze, and
there was every prospect of a successful ascension.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
On all sides could be heard comments concerning
what was about to take place.</p>

<p>“There, they seem to be all ready. All the
balloons are filled,” remarked Mollie. “I almost
wish I was going up in one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t! Not for the whole world!”
exclaimed Alice.</p>

<p>“Me either. Not for two worlds!” added Helen.</p>

<p>“Hello, there’s another,” remarked Bob as he
saw a tent being opened, and the pointed nose of
a fifth balloon was poked out.</p>

<p>“So it is,” admitted Jerry. “Say, that’s a queer
one. It’s a balloon and aeroplane combined.
That’s the stuff. That ought to do all sorts of
stunts.”</p>

<p>“That’s the kind I want,” declared Bob. “You
wouldn’t run much risk in that. If the gas gave
out or the bag busted you could depend on the
planes, and if they broke, why, you would be held
up by the balloon.”</p>

<p>“Suppose they both broke?” asked Helen.</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;oh, then&mdash;well, of course&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Bob was spared the trouble of finding an
answer by a shout from the crowd, which told that
something had happened.</p>

<p>An instant later five big bodies shot into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
air, as the men holding the balloons to the earth
let go of them.</p>

<p>“There they go! There they go!” cried Andy
Rush. “It’s a race&mdash;the dirigible balloon race!
Whoop la!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>A RACE IN THE AIR</small></h2>


<p>Andy’s excitement was shared not only by the
motor boys and their girl friends, but by the vast
throng gathered on the carnival grounds. There
was something inspiring in the sight of the vast
bulks of the balloons, skimming along through the
air like gigantic birds. They seemed to demonstrate
man’s conquest of the upper regions, even
as the locomotive, the automobile and motor boats
have shown what they can do to annihilate space
on the earth and in the water.</p>

<p>As the balloons rose in the air they seemed to
become smaller, and then they all headed in the
same direction, for, as Andy had said, there was to
be a race of the dirigible machines.</p>

<p>The motors of the balloons, banging away,
sounded like a battle in the air, and the propellers
whirled about so swiftly that they could not be
seen from the earth.</p>

<p>The airships went up perhaps two hundred feet,
all of them remaining near one another. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in a graceful sweep, they headed for a distant
church steeple, about three miles away, in the city
of Broadlands.</p>

<p>The conditions of the race, Andy told his
friends, was that the first dirigible to circle the
steeple and return to the grounds was to win a
valuable prize. In order to distinguish the airships
they had large numerals, from one to five, painted
on strips of muslin and fastened to them.</p>

<p>“They’re off!” cried Bob as the balloons, lining
up, started away toward the goal. They were
so far distant now that the explosions of the motors
could only be faintly heard.</p>

<p>“I’m for number three!” cried Mollie Horton.
“That looks as if it would win. Don’t you think
so, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to differ from a young lady, and a
pretty one at that,” replied Jerry, bowing to Mollie,
“but I think number five will win.”</p>

<p>This was the balloon with planes attached to
it, which had last made its appearance. It was
not so large, nor seemingly as powerful as any
of the others, but Jerry had reasons of his own
for choosing that one, in what was only a sort of
friendly guessing contest among the young folks.</p>

<p>“If we were in the auto now, we could follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
them,” said Ned. “See, some of the people are
doing that.”</p>

<p>“We’re just as well off here,” declared Jerry.
“We can see the finish. Besides, they’ll come back
quicker than they are going on this trip, and they
may beat the autos.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think they’ll return more
quickly?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Because they’ll come back with the wind. You
see they beat out against the breeze, and then, if an
accident happens, and their motor stops, they can
drift back with the wind to their sheds or tents.
A fellow who is helping one of the owners of a
dirigible told me that. It’s one of the tricks of
contests like this. You see, the wind will blow
them back, and if they don’t have an accident,
with the power of their motors to help the breeze,
they’re bound to come back in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Smart lad!” exclaimed Bob. “You are getting
ready for our motor ship, I see.”</p>

<p>“Are you boys going to have a motor ship?”
asked Alice Vines with great interest.</p>

<p>“We might; you never can tell,” returned Ned.
“Stranger things have happened.”</p>

<p>“I think strange things are always happening
to you boys,” commented Helen. “But I never,
never would go in an airship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe you will in ours,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll not,” she said. “I’m afraid to even
go up on a high ladder to pick cherries, and I
know I’d faint if I was ever as high as those men
are. I don’t see how they dare do it.”</p>

<p>She motioned to the operators of the dirigible
balloons, which were now only small specks in the
blue sky.</p>

<p>“Who’s ahead?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“You can’t tell at this distance,” said Jerry.
“But they’ll soon be coming back.”</p>

<p>It was so interesting, watching the race in the
air, even though it was some distance off, that the
time passed quickly. Almost before the young
people realized it the balloons seemed to be getting
larger.</p>

<p>“They’re coming back!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what!” declared Jerry. “Now we can
see which one will win. None of them seems to
have had any accidents.”</p>

<p>On the wind there were now borne to the ears of
the waiting crowd the sounds of the motor explosions.
Every moment they became louder.</p>

<p>“Number two is going to win!” cried Andy.
“It’s ahead!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jerry, I think you selected the wrong
one,” remarked Mollie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait,” was all Jerry said.</p>

<p>As they watched they saw number five balloon
suddenly shoot up into the air. The operator
had shifted his elevation rudder.</p>

<p>“What’s he doing that for?” asked Mollie.</p>

<p>“He probably wants to get into a swifter current
of air,” said Jerry. “He knows I want him
to win, and he’s very obliging.”</p>

<p>“Number four will take the prize,” declared
Andy, changing his mind. “See, it’s running away
from the others.”</p>

<p>Indeed, it did look as if that balloon, which was
the longest one of the five, would come in ahead.
It was rapidly shooting forward, and was only
about half a mile from where the start had been
made.</p>

<p>But there are tricks and surprises in ballooning as
in everything else, as the motor boys and their
friends soon learned. Number five balloon, which
had ascended to a considerable height, was suddenly
seen to descend. So rapidly did it shoot down
that there were cries of alarm from the throng.</p>

<p>“He’s had an accident! His motor has stopped!
The gas is leaking out! He’ll fall!”</p>

<p>But the man in the balloon, who could now be
seen as a small black object, did not seem to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
alarmed. He was calmly shifting several handles
and ropes.</p>

<p>“He’s going to win,” said Jerry quietly.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure,” cautioned Ned.</p>

<p>“You’ll see,” was Jerry’s reply.</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken when the descent of number
five was further quickened. Like an eagle
swooping down from the heights it fell toward the
earth, and a little later it had assumed an even
keel and shot over the finishing line, a winner by
several lengths.</p>

<p>What a shout went up then! Not only at the
success of the daring navigator of the air, but at
the whole spectacle, for presently all the other
ships of the clouds had finished the course, and were
hovering in the air above the heads of the throng,
while the aeronauts were throwing out ropes, that
they and their machines might be pulled back to
the earth.</p>

<p>“Do you see how he did it?” asked Jerry of his
chums.</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but he evidently won,” replied
Ned. “How did he manage to get ahead of the
others?”</p>

<p>“Why, he practically slid down a hillside of air.
He went up until he struck a current that would
carry him a little faster than the air strata would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
on which the others were shooting along. Then,
when he was near enough to the line, he pointed the
nose of his balloon downward by shifting the elevation
rudder, and he came slanting down, just as
we slide down a hill on our bob-sled. He had his
motor to help him, and he acquired a speed that
the others could not.”</p>

<p>“Say, you know something about ballooning,”
remarked Andy admiringly.</p>

<p>“You bet he does. It will come in handy when
we get our motor ship,” commented Bob. “I do
wish we had one like that dirigible, with the planes
on either side of it. Let’s go over and take a
look at it. It’s down now. I wonder if we could
ever build one like that, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I could&mdash;and a better one, too,” suddenly said
a man standing near the motor boys.</p>

<p>They turned and regarded him curiously. He
was rather young-looking, but he had gray hair,
and he seemed respectable.</p>

<p>“Could you build a balloon like that?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“I could&mdash;and a better one&mdash;one that would go
farther and stay up longer&mdash;but I’d need considerable
money to do it.”</p>

<p>Jerry looked at the man critically. A daring
plan had come into his mind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>PLANNING A MOTOR SHIP</small></h2>


<p>The crowd was running from all directions to
get closer views of the dirigible balloons before
they should be put away in the tents or sheds. The
man who had spoken to Ned stood near the motor
boys and their friends.</p>

<p>“Excuse me for intruding,” he said with a smile,
“but I could not help hearing what you were talking
about, and I felt that it would not be out of
place to say what I did.”</p>

<p>“Are you a builder of airships?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I have built one or two. I am also a balloonist.
I have plans, just perfected, for a very fine
motor ship, something like that one with planes
attached to the gas bag, but a great improvement
over it. But I need money to build it. I have a
model, however.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“At my home in Middletown.”</p>

<p>“That’s not far from where we are,” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Ned. “We’re from Cresville,” he added for the
stranger’s benefit.</p>

<p>“Are you interested in airships?” asked the
man.</p>

<p>“Very much so,” was Jerry’s answer. “We
would like to see your model, Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Glassford is my name&mdash;Rupert Glassford.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you bring your model here to exhibit
it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Because the committee would not let me. I
offered to, but they said they only wanted real
machines that would sail through the air.”</p>

<p>“Like Noddy’s tin fly,” spoke Ned with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a sample of some of the freaks they
allowed to be exhibited here,” went on the man
somewhat bitterly. “But a real airship, built on
up-to-date ideas, even if it was only a model, they
wouldn’t admit. If I could have shown it perhaps
I could have induced some rich man to put up
money enough to build one. As it is, I’ll have to
wait&mdash;and see others get ahead of me, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we could help you,” said Jerry quietly.
“How much would it take to build your motor
ship?”</p>

<p>“More than you boys could raise, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know how much these boys can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
raise!” exclaimed Andy Rush admiringly. “They
own a gold mine.”</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford laughed.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re affected by some of the sights
you’ve seen at this carnival,” he said to the little
chap.</p>

<p>“It’s true enough,” spoke Jerry quietly. “We
do own an interest in a valuable gold mine, and we
have considerable money. If a motor ship did not
cost too much we might build it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that?” exclaimed the man, a
hopeful look coming into his face.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I have been thinking of it for some
time. Ever since I heard of this carnival. I don’t
know how my chums feel about it, but, as for me,
I’m for an airship.”</p>

<p>“And we’re with you!” cried Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“Get an airship, Jerry,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“One with planes, so if we fall we’ll come down
easy,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“Chunky’s so heavy he doesn’t relish a fall from
the clouds,” remarked Alice.</p>

<p>“Are you boys really in earnest?” asked Mr.
Glassford.</p>

<p>“We certainly are,” declared Jerry. “If you
can show us a good model of a motor ship, and your
plans seem feasible, though I admit we don’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
much about such things, we will furnish the money
to build a dirigible balloon, provided, of course,
that the cost is not too high.”</p>

<p>“It will not cost as much as a high-class automobile
would,” said Mr. Glassford. “For five
thousand dollars I can build my motor ship, and
I know you’ll be satisfied with it.”</p>

<p>“When can we see the plans and model?” inquired
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Any time you want to. I’ll bring them to
Cresville if you say so.”</p>

<p>“That would be a good idea. Bob’s and Ned’s
fathers would probably want to look them over,
and my mother will likely take an interest in them.
So if you can come to Cresville next week we will
meet you. Suppose you come to my house?”</p>

<p>“I will be very pleased to. I can furnish references
that I know my business. I have built a number
of balloons, but this is my first attempt at a
dirigible one. I know I can succeed, however, and
if you will furnish the cash there is no reason why
you boys cannot take a long trip in one.”</p>

<p>“A trip for fame and fortune!” exclaimed Ned
enthusiastically. “Me for the motor ship. Automobiling
and motor boating are back numbers
now.”</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford left soon after this, promising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to come to Cresville in about a week, bringing his
plans and model with him, and also his references.</p>

<p>“Well, I wonder if there’ll be anything more to
see this afternoon?” remarked Jerry as the group
of young people moved away from the vicinity of
the dirigible balloons, which had nearly all been
put away.</p>

<p>“Kite-flying contests are on the program,” said
Andy.</p>

<p>But neither the boys nor girls cared much for
this, so they went to a vaudeville show on the
grounds, and then Ned treated the crowd to ice
cream. After that it was time for the girls to
start home, as they had only come with the intention
of remaining one day.</p>

<p>The boys bade them good-by with some feelings
of regret, and went to their hotel.</p>

<p>The following three days at the carnival were
given up to other contests of the dirigible balloons,
in every one of which number five, Jerry’s favorite,
was a winner. There were also aeroplane races and
contests, and, though these heavier-than-air machines
were rather limited in their flights, some of
them did remarkably well. But the boys held to
the dirigible balloon as the model which they would
have if everything went well and there was no
objection to their owning a motor ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>They left the carnival on Friday, as it was to
close the following day, and motored back to Cresville,
having spent an enjoyable week and learned
much about airships.</p>

<p>“I wonder what happened to Noddy after his
<i>Firefly</i> tried to plow up the earth?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I heard he took what was left of his machine
away from the grounds,” replied Andy, who was
a good news gatherer.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll show him an airship as is an airship,”
remarked Ned. “Wait until we get Mr.
Glassford to work on his.”</p>

<p>“We’ll put it all over Noddy,” was Bob’s opinion.
“Won’t he be mad, though!”</p>

<p>“Well, I only hope we can get a motor ship that
will work,” said Jerry thoughtfully. “The more
I see and hear of these air machines the more uncertain
I think they are. A strong wind seems to
play topsy-turvy with them. See what happened
to the aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ours won’t be that kind,” declared Ned.
“We’ll fly, all right. I wish we had it now, instead
of this auto, to get home in.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be glad of the auto,” replied
Jerry. “Still, I wish, too, that we had our new
motor ship.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>BUILDING THE COMET</small></h2>


<p>One evening, about a week after this, Jerry
Hopkins was seen hurrying down the main street
of Cresville. He walked fast and hardly looked
from right to left.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jerry,” called Frank Merton, one of his
town friends, “come over and have a plate of ice
cream.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. Haven’t time, Frank. I’m in a
hurry to catch Bob and Ned. Haven’t seen either
of them around, have you?”</p>

<p>“No. If I see ’em I’ll tell ’em you were lookin’
for ’em.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. It’s quite important.”</p>

<p>“Those motor boys are up to some new scheme,
I’ll bet a lemon,” remarked Frank as he strolled
on. “They’re always goin’ off somewhere, or
havin’ a good time. I wish I was in their crowd.”</p>

<p>Which is what a number of other boys, not only
of Cresville, but of other places, have also wished.</p>

<p>Jerry hurried on, but he did not catch sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
either of his chums. He proceeded to Ned Slade’s
house, and there, on the big front porch, comfortably
swinging in hammocks, were the two lads.</p>

<p>“Well, I must say you’re taking it easy,” observed
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Sure. Why not?” asked Bob. “What’s your
rush? You look as if you’d been walking fast.”</p>

<p>“So I have. I’ve been looking for you two.
He’s come.”</p>

<p>“Who’s come?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Mr. Glassford, the man who’s going to build
our motor ship for us. He arrived at my house
half an hour ago. He was delayed in getting his
model shipped, and that’s why he wasn’t here yesterday,
when we expected him.”</p>

<p>“Has he got the model now?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s a dandy.”</p>

<p>“Did he bring plans, so he can build a big one
for us?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“He sure did. Come on and look ’em over.
That’s why I came for you. Did you tell your
folks about our plans?”</p>

<p>“You mean building an airship?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“I did,” declared Bob. “My mother thinks it’s
all talk, but we’ll show her.”</p>

<p>“My dad doesn’t take much stock in it,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Ned. “I guess he thinks it will fizzle
out.”</p>

<p>“Wait until they see the plans and the model,”
said Jerry. “That will show we mean business.
But come on. I told Mr. Glassford I’d come right
back with you.”</p>

<p>All enthusiasm, the two boys leaped from the
hammocks, and were soon accompanying Jerry
back to his house. There they found their acquaintance
of the carnival, but what attracted their
attention as soon as they entered the library where
he was sitting was a complete model of a curious
airship, about three feet long, which was suspended
from the chandelier.</p>

<p>“There’s a small size model of the future
<i>Comet</i>,” exclaimed Jerry. “You see, I’ve named
our motor ship already, just as I did our motor
boat.”</p>

<p>“<i>Comet’s</i> a good name,” was Mr. Glassford’s
opinion. “Now, if you boys will draw up your
chairs I’ll briefly explain my plans for a motor
ship.”</p>

<p>With the aid of diagrams, blue-prints, sketches,
profiles and some simple tables of calculations, Mr.
Glassford demonstrated, by frequent references to
the model, just how it would be possible to sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
through the air for a long time in a ship built on
the lines of his invention.</p>

<p>The motor ship was to consist of a big cigar-shaped
bag of very strong material to hold the
gas. It was divided into several compartments,
so that in case one or even three or four were
punctured there would be enough sustaining power
to keep the ship and its crew afloat. The gas used
was a combination of hydrogen and another vapor,
the secret of which Mr. Glassford would not disclose.
Sufficient to say that it was a very powerful
combination.</p>

<p>The gas bag fitted inside a light but very strong
framework, braced with piano wire, and on either
side of this frame, standing at right angles to the
long bag, were several planes, made of light canvas,
stretched over poles of bamboo. These, in
effect, made a combined balloon and aeroplane,
giving the advantages of both, and somewhat neutralizing
the defects of each one.</p>

<p>Below the bag, with the framework supporting
the planes, was the body of the ship&mdash;the car&mdash;containing
the motor and the devices for operating
it, as well as the rudders, propellers and planes,
which could be shifted.</p>

<p>The car was large, or, rather, the plans called
for a good-sized one. There would be a comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
cabin, in which the travelers would live during
the day, doing their cooking on a stove which utilized
the exhaust gas from the motor. There was
also another room, where five small berths provided
sleeping accommodations. These berths could be
folded up during the day, and as the room containing
them was well forward, it made a good
place to sit when the ship was in motion, for an
excellent view could be had from the big windows.</p>

<p>The entire car was enclosed, so that storms
would not affect the travelers. The motor was in
a small room by itself, and there was a little pilot
house, on top of the bunk room, in which the
operator stood, being able to control, stop or start
the motor from there, as well as adjust the two
rudders or shift the planes.</p>

<p>There were two sets of rudders, though one, as
has been explained, was more like a big box-kite
than a rudder. This controlled the depression or
elevation of the ship. The other, shaped like a
fish-tail, sent it to right or left.</p>

<p>The planes on either side of the gas bag were
intended to better balance the motor ship, to render
it less liable to be sent out of its course by contrary
winds, and to support it in case of accidents. The
planes were on the same principle as a bird’s wings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
when it is gliding or swooping down from a great
height.</p>

<p>There was ample store room for supplies, provisions,
some ballast and a few duplicate parts of
the motor. Water was carried in a large tank, and
there was another for a plentiful supply of gasolene.
The motor ship had many novel features,
and there were so many points of interest about it,
as Mr. Glassford explained to them, that the boys
hardly noted them all at the time of going over
the plans.</p>

<p>“It certainly seems as if it would work,” remarked
Bob at length.</p>

<p>“Oh, it will work,” declared the inventor quickly.
“Why, the gas bag, with the peculiar vapor I put
into it, would lift twice as much weight as I intend
to carry.”</p>

<p>“And you say it will not cost more than six
thousand dollars to build it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I think I can easily do it for five thousand.
That is less than you paid for your touring car,
you told me.”</p>

<p>“Yes; with the improvements we’ve put on it
the cost has run beyond that,” admitted Jerry.
“Well, fellows, what do you say? Shall we use
part of our income from the gold mine, and build
the <i>Comet</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Ned quickly.</p>

<p>“Every time,” added Bob. “I want a trip
through the air.”</p>

<p>“Then the next thing is to tell your folks, and
get their consent to spend the money,” went on
Jerry. “I have already won my mother over.”</p>

<p>Though the boys had a considerable sum at their
disposal, from a gold mine which they had been
fortunate enough to help an old prospector to discover
on one of their trips, they never spent an
unusual sum without obtaining the consent of their
parents.</p>

<p>“When can you let me know?” asked Mr. Glassford
somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” replied Bob, and Ned nodded
to indicate that he too would have an answer by
then.</p>

<p>“How long will it take to build it after we provide
the money?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“About a month. You see, much of the material
I will need is already in stock in shops that
make a specialty of airship supplies. The motor
I can easily get, and the principal work will be
putting the ship together. You boys can help me
on it, and in a month, at the most, we ought to
be able to make our first trip.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going home now, and see dad,” said Ned,
as he got up. “I’m so anxious I can’t wait.”</p>

<p>“Bring your parents here, and let me explain
my plans to them,” proposed Mr. Glassford, and
this was voted a good idea.</p>

<p>At first Ned’s and Bob’s folks only laughed at
their sons’ pleas, but as the boys insisted that they
really meant to have an airship, Mr. and Mrs.
Slade and Mr. and Mrs. Baker finally gave in,
and accompanied the lads to Jerry’s house. There
Mr. Glassford went over all the details again,
explaining how it was practically impossible to run
any serious risk.</p>

<p>Not without some misgivings, however, did the
respective parents give their consent. But they
finally did, which was all the boys cared about, and
a contract was drawn up and signed by Mr. Glassford
and Mrs. Hopkins, Mr. Baker and Mr. Slade,
the boys being barred because they were not of legal
age.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Mr. Glassford should have
the use of a big loft in a storage building owned by
Mr. Slade, where he kept some of the goods sold
in his department store. There the work of building
the airship could be started. When it had
progressed as far as was possible in there, it was
to be taken out and a large tent erected in a vacant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
lot. There the gas bag could be inflated, the
planes and car attached, and all made ready for a
flight.</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford lost no time, once the money
was provided, and in less than a week from his
arrival in Cresville he was at work on the ship,
with three enthusiastic boys to aid him&mdash;no, four
boys, for Andy Rush was allowed to come in,
though he talked more than he worked.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>NODDY MAKES TROUBLE</small></h2>


<p>Of course, it was impossible, in a small town
like Cresville, for the motor boys to undertake the
building of anything as large as a motor ship without
the news becoming pretty generally known. In
fact, almost everything the three chums did was
town-talk, for they were well-known and popular
lads, and a source of no little pride to the residents
of the place, who were eager to tell of the exploits
of the lads.</p>

<p>So, naturally, Noddy Nixon heard of the boys’
project. Noddy was sore over the failure of his
<i>Firefly</i>. He was also angry because he had lost
his wager with the fat man, and because his father
had cut down his allowance on account of the damages
Mr. Nixon had had to pay for the destruction
of the lemonade stand.</p>

<p>The construction of the <i>Comet</i> had not been
under way more than a week ere Noddy began
making slighting remarks about it to whoever would
listen to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor did he confine his remarks to friends or acquaintances
of the motor boys. Whenever he saw
Jerry, Ned or Bob in the street he would, in passing,
remark, loud enough for them to hear, something
about their motor ship, ending with a sneering
phrase or laugh. But the boys paid no attention
to him. They had faith in Mr. Glassford,
and, to tell the truth, they were so busy helping the
inventor that they had little time to bother with
Noddy.</p>

<p>At length the building of the motor ship had
progressed as far as was possible in the somewhat
contracted space of the loft. The gas bag was all
sewed, the framework was all ready to be put together,
the planes had been made, the rudders constructed,
and now little remained to do but assemble
the ship, and then fit up the car, or body of
it. The motor was on hand, but had not been
set in its place.</p>

<p>Jerry had arranged to hire a big tent from Boston,
and this had been set up in the midst of a field
owned by Mr. Baker. Of course, after this had
been done, there crowded out to the canvas shelter
nearly every inhabitant of Cresville, for every one
was anxious to get a view of the wonderful airship.</p>

<p>But the boys hired several men to mount guard,
for, though they did not want to deprive their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
friends of an opportunity to see the invention, they
feared lest some too-curious one might cause damage
by handling parts of the machinery or ship.</p>

<p>So they only admitted a few at a time, and this
only after working hours, when they and Mr.
Glassford could be on hand to watch over
their property. The <i>Comet</i> was beginning
to assume shape now, and looked like a real
airship, though the big bag was only half filled
with gas, enough to partly distend it, so that the
cord netting could be constructed over it.</p>

<p>One day, when the boys and Mr. Glassford were
quite busy, there entered the tent an old man. The
boys did not see him at first, as he was on the opposite
side of the gas bag, but Jerry’s attention was
attracted by seeing the gas envelope sway, and when
he looked he saw the old man trying to tear it.</p>

<p>“Here! What are you doing?” cried Jerry.
“Keep your hands off that. How’d you get in here,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I jest walked in. I ain’t never seen a airship,
an’ I wanted to see if this here stuff was strong,”
was the answer given in a high-pitched, unpleasant
voice. The old man continued to pull on the bag,
though it was strong enough to resist his efforts.</p>

<p>“Drop that and clear out of here!” cried Jerry,
recognizing the old man as Sid Joffy, a sort of recluse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and town character, who was a general nuisance.
He was too lazy to work, and how he managed
to live no one knew. He had an old cabin
in the woods, on the edge of a clearing, and resided
there all alone.</p>

<p>“What’s this? Your engine?” went on Joffy,
letting go of the gas bag and beginning to turn
some wheels and valves on the gasolene motor,
which stood in one corner of the tent.</p>

<p>“Can’t you leave things alone?” cried Mr. Glassford
sharply. “Who let him in, boys?”</p>

<p>“Guess he must have slipped past Tom Johnson
at the tent flap,” replied Jerry. “Come, now,
Sid, clear out of here. You can see us when we
go up.”</p>

<p>“I want to see how the thing works,” went on
the old man, moving away from Jerry, who was
approaching. “I like machinery considerable,”
and he began to pull on the lever that operated the
elevation rudder.</p>

<p>“Drop that and get out of here, or we’ll put
you out!” cried Jerry, now thoroughly aroused, and
the old man hastened from the tent.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose brought him around?”
asked Ned, as he paused in the work of tightening
the bolts on the framework.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a general butter-in,” said Bob. “He’s
always around where he isn’t wanted.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I scared him off,” remarked Jerry
with a laugh.</p>

<p>But that same afternoon Joffy was back again.
This time he crawled under the tent, and before the
boys were aware of his presence he had knocked a
heavy wrench down from a bench and broken one
of the bamboo braces of the air planes.</p>

<p>“Here, you! You’re worse than the kids!”
cried Jerry. “What are you doing here, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I didn’t mean to break it,” said the old man.
“I wanted to see how heavy that wrench was.”</p>

<p>“Well, you saw, all right,” went on Jerry. “Now
clear out.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather funny, him coming back,” said
Ned, after the man had gone. “Do you suppose
he’s trying to steal some of your ideas, Mr. Glassford?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe so. My greatest secret
is the gas, and no one knows that but myself.”</p>

<p>“Sid Joffy is too lazy to steal anything,” remarked
Bob. “He wouldn’t steal second or third
base if he was playing on a ball nine. I guess he
hasn’t anything else to do, and he comes around
here to bother us.”</p>

<p>“I wish he’d keep away,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>He wished that more strongly than ever the next
day, when the old man was again found in the tent,
though how he entered the boys did not know.
This time, before he could be detected, he had unscrewed
some of the framework, and caused it to
sag over against the bag, which it might have punctured.</p>

<p>“Say! This is the limit!” cried Ned. “What
are you up to, anyhow, Joffy?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I just wanted to see how tight you had to
have your frame. I&mdash;I didn’t mean any harm.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve done harm, all right,” said Jerry
angrily. “If we catch you in here again we’ll run
you down to the river and duck you.”</p>

<p>“That ought to keep him away,” observed Bob,
when the nuisance had hurried from the tent. “He
hates water. I guess he never took a bath in his
life.”</p>

<p>“There’s something queer about his coming
around here, boys,” said Jerry. “I don’t like it.
Seems to me as if he had more of an object than
mere curiosity. We must keep watch of him.”</p>

<p>“It is rather odd that he comes over here so
often,” admitted Ned. “It’s quite a distance from
his shack, and he doesn’t like walking, or any other
exercise.”</p>

<p>But the secret of Joffy’s visits was disclosed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
next day, when Andy Rush, all excited and hardly
able to breathe, hurried into the tent.</p>

<p>“I seen ’em!” he cried. “Joffy an’ Noddy&mdash;talking
together&mdash;they’re up to some trick&mdash;Noddy
pointed toward our tent&mdash;Joffy nodded his head&mdash;then
Noddy gave him some money. I’ll bet
Noddy’s put him up to all this&mdash;to bother you
boys.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” declared Jerry emphatically. “I
knew it must be something more than Joffy’s curiosity
that brought him here. Boys, this is part of
Noddy’s plan to make trouble for us. He’s mad
because we’re going to have a better airship than his
tin fly that never flew. But we’ll fix him!”</p>

<p>“Let’s make sure that he put Joffy up to it,
though,” proposed Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be easy enough. Wait until the
old man comes in again and I’ll tackle him.”</p>

<p>They had not long to wait. That very afternoon
the old nuisance sneaked in again, coming
under the tent so quietly that he was not noticed
until a crash in a corner told that something had
happened. Joffy, in reaching up to finger one of
the big propellers, had knocked it from the shaft,
to which it was not yet fastened. Fortunately,
little damage had been done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“There you are again!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;Mr. Hopkins&mdash;I’m here agin,” admitted
Joffy with an uneasy grin. “I&mdash;I didn’t
mean to do any damage. I&mdash;I jest wanted to see
if that there thing-a-ma-bob would whirl around.”</p>

<p>“Well, it did, all right, and you might have
broken it. If you had we would arrest you for
malicious mischief.”</p>

<p>“Arrest me! Why, I ain’t done nothin’!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have!” exclaimed Jerry. “You’re
taking money from Noddy Nixon to come here and
annoy us. Now, don’t deny it!” he cried as he
saw that the old man was about to protest. “Andy
Rush saw you. We know, now, why you sneak
in here. You want to keep away if you don’t want
to get arrested.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;all right, Mr. Hopkins. I’ll go if
you don’t want me around.”</p>

<p>“Of course we don’t want you.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t mean no harm. I jest&mdash;I jest
wanted to see if that there big thing like a paddle
would go around.”</p>

<p>“Well, you saw; now vamoose.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll keep away?” asked Ned, as
the old man crawled under the tent and went outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe he will because I told him to,”
said Jerry, “but I’ve got a plan to make him.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Come over here and I’ll tell you.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>JOFFY SEES A “GHOST”</small></h2>


<p>Following a low-voiced conversation among
the boys, to which Andy Rush, in recognition of the
service he had rendered, was admitted, Bob exclaimed:</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff! That ought to cure him of
bothering us. How soon can you have it ready,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“In a couple of days. I’ll work on it at odd
times, as I don’t want things here to get behind.
There’s lots to do yet on the airship.”</p>

<p>“I hope you boys are not going to desert me,”
remarked Mr. Glassford, as he overheard Jerry’s
closing words. “I’ll need your help every day
now.”</p>

<p>“No, we’re only getting up a little plan to scare
that old nuisance, Joffy, and keep him away from
this tent,” explained Jerry. “If we don’t, he’s
likely to damage our <i>Comet</i>.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, he is. Scare him good and proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
while you’re at it. But now, if you’re ready, we’ll
adjust the planes and see how they look.”</p>

<p>The boys were very busy the remainder of the
day, and when they were finished the airship looked
more than ever like a machine that would navigate
the upper regions. It was large and imposing,
and would be more so when the car containing
the machinery was in position.</p>

<p>That night Jerry and his chums spent several
hours in the big tent, taking cautious observations
outside, every now and then, to see that neither
Noddy nor Joffy were sneaking around to spy on
them. The motor boys were not much bothered by
the lads of the town, for they had promised all
the youngsters, who did not annoy them by trying
to gain admittance to the tent at forbidden times,
a trip in the airship.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s ’most done,” remarked Ned, when,
close to midnight, the boys left the tent, a watchman
being on guard to insure that no damage would
come to the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes, we did better than I thought we would,”
admitted Jerry. “I can make the dummy to-morrow
night and then, with a couple of lanterns
fastened to it, we’ll be all ready to give Joffy
something to think about.”</p>

<p>The next day the troublesome old man was seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
around the tent, but he did not attempt to enter.
Possibly he did not see a good chance to annoy the
boys.</p>

<p>“Is everything ready, Jerry?” asked Bob that
evening, when, after their day’s work on the airship,
the four lads were gathered in the tent.</p>

<p>“All ready,” replied the chief conspirator. “All
I have to do is daub a little phosphorus on the dummy
and it will be in shape to do the ghost dance.
But I don’t want to do that until the last minute.
How’s the wind, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Good, and in the right direction. We can
stand in the clearing, and let it go right over his
cabin.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff. Well, we’ll start as soon as
it gets a little darker.”</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums gathered up several mysterious-looking
packages, and a little later they left
the tent by the rear, crawling under the canvas to
keep out of sight of any prying ones who might
be gathered in front.</p>

<p>It was about a mile to where Sid Joffy lived
alone in his cabin on the edge of the clearing. The
boys soon covered the distance, however, and came
to a halt in a little clump of woodland, just opposite
the somewhat dilapidated shack where the shiftless
man made his home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s in, for I can see a light in the cabin,”
whispered Ned.</p>

<p>“There’s no telling by that,” replied Jerry.
“He’d leave a lamp burning all day and night
rather than take the trouble to blow it out. Sneak
up there and take a look in.”</p>

<p>“I will,” volunteered Bob.</p>

<p>“No, Chunky, you’re too heavy to go lightly.
Let Andy go. He’s small and not so easily seen.
But hold your hand over your mouth, Andy, so
you won’t get to talking by mistake.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” promised the little chap, proud to be
in on some scheme with his friends the motor boys.</p>

<p>He glided off into the darkness, and presently
returned.</p>

<p>“Is Joffy there?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and some one’s with him.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!”</p>

<p>“Noddy! Then he’s probably plotting with
Joffy to annoy us in some other way,” declared
Jerry in a whisper. “Well, we’ll kill two birds
with one stone, and give Noddy a scare too. Have
you got the cord fastened on, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Yep. It’s all right. Easy, there, Bob, you
nearly stepped through the kite.”</p>

<p>“Yes; don’t break that, or it’s all off,” cautioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Jerry, as he anxiously inspected a large box-kite,
which was one of the things he and his chums
had brought along. It was not damaged, and a
little later it was silently rising through the air,
floating in the direction of Joffy’s lonely cottage.</p>

<p>“Now for the dummy,” whispered Jerry. “Hold
the kite string, Bob, while I fasten the ‘ghost’ on.”</p>

<p>Bob did as requested, and Jerry attached to the
stout kite cord a light figure, in the shape of a man,
but clad in ghostly white.</p>

<p>“Now for the phosphorus,” went on Jerry, when
he had the dummy in place. “Don’t get it on your
clothes, fellows.”</p>

<p>He poured a solution of the glowing stuff over
the dummy, and then more cord was let out. There
was a good breeze blowing, and soon the kite had
carried the dummy right over the cabin.</p>

<p>“Now the lanterns,” ordered Jerry. “Hand
’em here, Ned.”</p>

<p>Ned passed over two red Chinese lanterns, in
which candles were burning. They were fastened
to the string, and when up in the air looked like
two fiery eyes, staring down from the blackness,
for the night was very dark.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s all to the lolly-pops!” exclaimed
Andy in a hoarse whisper. “That’ll scare him
out of a year’s growth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t so bad,” admitted Jerry, “even if I did
make it myself.”</p>

<p>He let out some more string, and then he and
the other boys went a little nearer to the cabin,
taking care to keep out of sight by crouching down
behind the underbrush.</p>

<p>“All ready, fellows,” whispered Jerry a little
while afterward. “Groan for all you’re worth!”</p>

<p>A moment later such a series of unearthly noises
came from the depths of the woods that it sounded
as though something dreadful had happened. The
boys fairly outdid themselves.</p>

<p>“Here he comes!” said Jerry in a low voice, and
a moment later a small patch of light, which had
indicated that Joffy had opened his door, became
larger, as he threw wide the portal.</p>

<p>The boys groaned more weirdly than before.</p>

<p>“What is it&mdash;cats?” the conspirators in their
place of hiding heard some one from within the
hut ask old Joffy. They recognized Noddy
Nixon’s voice.</p>

<p>“I never knowed cats to be around here,” replied
the man as he stepped from his cabin. He
looked all about, and, of course, could see nothing.
Then he gazed up.</p>

<p>No sooner had he done so than he let out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
frightened yell, which drowned the noise of the
groans.</p>

<p>“Look! See!” shouted Joffy, pointing upward.
“It’s a ghost! It’s a ghost in the air over my
cabin! It’s come to haunt me! I’m a dead man!
This is a warnin’ to me! My days are numbered!
<a href="#image03">Oh! the ghost! the ghost!</a>”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_111">“OH! THE GHOST, THE GHOST!” SHOUTED JOFFY.</a></div>
</div>

<p>Jerry gave the kite cord a yank, and the phosphorous-covered
figure swayed weirdly high in
the air.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s comin’ after me!” screamed Joffy.
“He’s comin’ to git me! Save me, Noddy, save
me!”</p>

<p>Hardly able to keep up their groaning because
of their laughter, the boys saw Noddy rush to the
door. He looked up to where Joffy pointed, and
he too saw the ghostly figure.</p>

<p>Jerry groaned in a blood-curdling manner,
yanked the string until the strange figure danced
again, and then in a hollow voice announced:</p>

<p>“Beware! Beware of the airship! Approach
it not, or it will be your death. Beware! Beware!”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! I’ll never go near it agin! Never!
never! Not the longest day I live and draw the
breath of life! Good Mr. Ghost, please don’t kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
me this time, an’ I’ll be good! Please, please,
good Mr. Ghost!”</p>

<p>Whether Joffy’s words took what little nerve
Noddy had, or whether the sight of the ghost-like
figure scared him, the boys could not determine,
but with a frightened yell the bully dashed from
the cabin and started across the clearing for town.</p>

<p>Jerry rapidly pulled in on the cord, and the
figure in the air, with the two red points dangling
below it, seemed to be rushing down from the sky
to attack the fleeing youth. Joffy saw it, and with
a frightened scream he, too, took to his heels and
disappeared into the darkness after Noddy.</p>

<p>“They’ll never stop running until they get to
the town,” announced Jerry, as he gave a final
series of groans, in which the boys joined. “I
guess we’ve taught both of them a lesson they
won’t forget in a hurry,” and he proceeded to reel
in the kite cord, to haul down the lanterns and
the dummy.</p>

<p>“It worked better than I thought it would,”
said Ned as the motor boys started for home in
great glee at having played this trick on their
mean enemies.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>PROFESSOR SNODGRASS ON HAND</small></h2>


<p>The trick with the dummy and the box-kite
proved very effective, as far as Sid Joffy was concerned.
The boys heard later that he arrived in
town all out of breath, and much frightened.</p>

<p>He told a queer tale of a flaming figure hovering
over his cabin, and wanted some of the town
police to go back to his hut and exorcise the spirit.
But no one paid any attention to Joffy, as he was
known as a worthless character. He was so frightened
that he would not go back home, but remained
in the village all night, sleeping under the hotel
shed. Nor did he ever again approach the tent
where the airship was being constructed.</p>

<p>As for Noddy, inquiries showed that he had left
town for a few days, giving out that he had gone
to visit relatives in the country. They did not
realize how bitter the bully felt toward them, nor
what he hoped to do in the future to injure them.</p>

<p>“I guess he caught on to the fact that we were
at the bottom of the affair,” suggested Jerry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
“Very likely he knew he’d be laughed at for running
from a dummy figure, and so he sneaked away.
Well, I’m not sorry. We’ll soon want to try the
<i>Comet</i>, and if he was around he might make
trouble for us.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>“When do you think we’ll be in shape for a trial
flight, Jerry?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t know for sure. In a few days, I expect.
We’ll ask Mr. Glassford.”</p>

<p>The boys were discussing the happenings of the
previous night as they walked toward the big tent.
They found the inventor busily engaged, having
arrived before them. They asked when he thought
the machine would be completed, and received the
encouraging news that a few days more would see
the finishing touches put on it.</p>

<p>“I’m going to change the propellers somewhat,”
said Mr. Glassford. “I’ve been doing some calculating,
and I think with a three-bladed one, instead
of two, as at present, we could make better
progress. We must provide for going against as
stiff a breeze as we’re likely to encounter, and that
is no small item, for with the large area of the gas
bag for the air currents to act upon, it will need
all the power of our motor to send the ship ahead
at times. There is no use disguising the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
a motor ship is at more of a disadvantage in a
wind than is any other kind of a craft. However,
with the planes, I hope to overcome many difficulties
that now beset machines of this kind.”</p>

<p>The boys soon busied themselves at their tasks
on the construction of the <i>Comet</i>, for each one had
certain allotted work to do, Mr. Glassford, in addition,
laboring himself, overseeing what the lads
did.</p>

<p>While they were all thus busily engaged, Jerry
was aware of a dispute going on at the entrance
to the tent. He heard the voice of Tom Johnson,
the man hired to remain on guard, raised in protest
against the approach of some one.</p>

<p>“I tell you that you can’t go in!” exclaimed Tom.
“They don’t allow it. No one is allowed inside
while they’re working.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I must go in. I want to see them on
a very particular matter,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Is it that old nuisance, Sid Joffy, coming back
to bother us?” asked Mr. Glassford. “If it is
we’ll have him arrested. I thought you said, Jerry,
that you scared him so that he wouldn’t come
around again.”</p>

<p>“And so I did. That isn’t Joffy’s voice. I
think I know who it is. Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>Jerry laid aside the work he was engaged upon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and strode toward the tent flap. As he approached
he heard Johnson saying:</p>

<p>“If you try to go in I’ll stop you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare touch me!” was the indignant
answer. “If you do&mdash;but excuse me, my dear man,
just a moment now&mdash;don’t stir, that’s a good fellow.
I’ll have him off you in a minute. Don’t
stir, I beg of you, as you value&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is it a snake?” cried the guard. “If it is take
him off, quick! I’m terrible afraid of snakes!”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not a snake; it is a most perfect specimen
of a horse-fly. I have long desired to catch
one. Stand perfectly still.”</p>

<p>There was a little movement outside the tent.
Jerry heard Johnson give a startled exclamation,
and then he heard another voice triumphantly cry
out:</p>

<p>“I have it! It is a very valuable specimen. I
am a thousand times obliged to you.”</p>

<p>Jerry threw back the tent flap, and saw standing
beside Johnson a small man, with a very large pair
of spectacles on; and the little man was carefully
putting into a box a big, buzzing fly. Jerry knew,
almost before he had left the tent, whom he was
going to see. I presume my readers have already
guessed who it was, but, if not, Jerry’s excited exclamation
will tell you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!” he cried. “Where did
you come from? I haven’t seen you since you captured
the horned toad in California.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Jerry. It has been quite a while.
But I was just fortunate enough to capture the most
perfect specimen I have ever seen of a green horse-fly.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know green horses were ever bothered
with flies,” remarked Jerry, a twinkle in his eyes,
while he shook hands with the professor, an example
which was followed by Ned and Bob, who
came outside when they heard the mention of their
scientific friend.</p>

<p>“Ah, Jerry, you will have your joke, I see. You
know what I mean. But wait. There! now I
have him safely put away,” and the scientist thrust
into a small box the protesting insect.</p>

<p>“Did you get that off me?” asked Johnson.</p>

<p>“I did, my man. You may consider that you
have been a great aid to science to-day,” added
Uriah Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be so no more,” retorted the
man energetically. “If any more of the nasty flies
gets on me I’ll&mdash;I’ll smash ’em&mdash;that’s what I’ll
do.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t,” begged the professor. “They
are too valuable to kill. Save them for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Were you looking for us?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I was,” replied Professor Snodgrass. “I happened
to be in this part of the country, searching
for a new variety of tree-toad I have heard about,
and having a few hours to spare I called at your
house, Jerry. Your mother was not at home, but
the girl said you and your chums were down camping
in this lot. Seems to me you have chosen
rather a public place to go camping. And why
you have such a large tent is more than I can
imagine.”</p>

<p>“We’re not camping, professor.”</p>

<p>“No? What are you doing, then?”</p>

<p>“We’re building an airship.”</p>

<p>“Building&mdash;an&mdash;airship!”</p>

<p>The professor’s voice indicated his astonishment.</p>

<p>“That’s what we are,” went on Ned. “Come
on in and see it. We’ve got it almost done. We’ll
have a trial flight soon.”</p>

<p>“An airship! Building an airship!” repeated
the scientist, as if unable to believe what he had
heard.</p>

<p>He was led inside the tent. The big proportions
of the <i>Comet</i> seemed to amaze him.</p>

<p>“It really is an airship,” he said, as if, up to that
moment, there had been some doubt about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course it is, and we’re going to take a long
trip in it,” went on Jerry. “What do you think of
the idea?”</p>

<p>“Excellent! Most excellent!” cried the professor
enthusiastically. “I hardly knew what to
think at first, but it is most excellent. That is better
than the motor boat or the automobile. You will
be able to go where you please now. How did
you come to think of it?”</p>

<p>Jerry related the outcome of their visit to the
Broadlands carnival, telling of how they met Mr.
Glassford. The inventor was introduced to the
scientist, and they seemed to be on friendly terms
at once.</p>

<p>“A trip through the air,” mused the professor.
“That is a great idea&mdash;a great idea. Most excellent.
There, I have it!” he cried suddenly.</p>

<p>“What? Another green horse-fly?” asked Johnson,
thrusting his head in through the tent flap.</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed the professor. “Boys, I have
an idea&mdash;an excellent idea. I will sail with you
in your airship. I’ll go with you in the interest of
science&mdash;science and&mdash;and bugs. I’ll write a volume
on the insects of the upper air, and gather all
the specimens I can for illustrations. My! but
I’m glad I happened to come here to-day. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a rare fly, and now comes the chance to do what I
always wanted to&mdash;sail in the air!”</p>

<p>“You’re just in time, then,” said Jerry. “We
are going to have a trial in about three days.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE MOTOR SHIP SAILS</small></h2>


<p>Though Jerry had told Professor Snodgrass
that the <i>Comet</i> would have a trial flight in about
three days, it was not until five had passed that
all was in readiness. Almost at the last moment
Mr. Glassford decided on changes which took some
time to make.</p>

<p>However, the professor was in no hurry, if the
boys were. He was a guest at Jerry’s house, and
his time was fully occupied in catching strange insects,
or getting new specimens of old ones. For
the professor was employed by a prominent
museum to gather materials for exhibit and for
experimental purposes. His latest exploit had been
to accompany the boys on their trip to California,
where he went in search of a horned toad, which
he captured after considerable trouble.</p>

<p>“Well, professor, are you all ready for a flight
through the air?” asked Jerry one evening.</p>

<p>“I think so. Why?”</p>

<p>“We are scheduled to make our first trial trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to-morrow. That is, if Mr. Glassford doesn’t find
something else that needs changing. I suppose
you’ll be on hand?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I have had a new style of net made,
with a very long handle, to enable me to reach
out and capture any curious insects I may see in
the upper regions. How high do you think you
will go; two or three miles?”</p>

<p>“Mercy, Jerry, I hope you don’t go as high as
that!” exclaimed Mrs. Hopkins, who was listening
to the talk.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, mother. We’re not likely to go
more than a few hundred feet in the trial.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jerry, I wish I had never consented to this.
I am afraid something will happen.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, Mrs. Hopkins,” said Uriah
Snodgrass. “There is really little danger with such
a competent person as Mr. Glassford managing
matters. It is practically impossible for the balloon
to fall, with its gas bag and the planes in addition.
That is a very novel combination.”</p>

<p>“But they may get caught in the upper air, and
not be able to get down.”</p>

<p>“Then all we’d have to do would be to let out
a little gas, mother. Oh, we have all emergencies
provided for.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hope so,” murmured Jerry’s mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
“I shall be nervous until I hear that the ascent is
safely made.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll know by this time to-morrow,”
said Jerry. “Now I think I’ll go to bed. I want
to get up early, for there’ll probably be something
unexpected to do at the last minute. How about
you, professor?”</p>

<p>“I think I shall stay up a while yet. I want to
get a new specimen of a lightning-bug I noticed
in the garden. It was a rare kind, and I almost
had one when a mosquito bit me and I had to let
the lightning-bug go. But I shall catch it. I will
be with you in the morning.”</p>

<p>Jerry once more reassured his mother that there
was no danger in what he and his chums were
about to undertake, and then he retired.</p>

<p>There was a big crowd about the tent early the
next morning, for news had spread that the <i>Comet</i>
was to be “launched,” if that is the proper term
for floating an airship. Probably “floated” would
be better.</p>

<p>“Well, is everything in good shape?” asked
Jerry of Mr. Glassford, as he greeted the inventor
in the canvas shelter.</p>

<p>“I think so. The motor seems to work perfectly.
That was my greatest anxiety. I will now proceed
to generate the gas necessary to completely fill the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
bag. I suppose all three of you boys are coming
along?”</p>

<p>“Of course; and so is Professor Snodgrass.”</p>

<p>“That will make a nice party, and we will not
have to carry so much ballast. Just go over all
the cords, see that none are tangled, and test the
wire stays and the braces. We don’t want any
accident to happen.”</p>

<p>The boys were a trifle nervous, now that the
time was at hand for the great test. Would the
airship rise? Would she sail through the upper
atmosphere&mdash;or come down like a stone?</p>

<p>The big gas bag seemed to promise that at least
they would go up, but whether they could advance,
and whether the <i>Comet</i> would allow herself to
be directed in response to the influences of her
propellers and the rudders was another matter.
Mr. Glassford was busy at the gas-generating machine.
The long, cigar-shaped bag began to distend
more and more. The frame of the ship quivered
as the lifting power of the gas began to make
itself felt. But for the weight of many bags of
sand, attached to the lower part of the car, it might
have risen right in the tent.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll go up, all right,” declared Bob
earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what it will!” exclaimed Andy Rush.
“Gee, but I wish I was going!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps next time, Andy,” spoke Jerry kindly
to the little fellow. “It’s too much of a risk yet.”</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford hurried about, looking at the
various parts. He seemed as nervous as did the
boys. Outside could be heard the murmur of a vast
throng.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we may as well take it out of
the tent,” remarked the inventor at length, as he
shut off the supply of gas and closed the valves.
“Open the tent, men.”</p>

<p>A number of helpers had been engaged, and
these now busied themselves opening the whole
front of the tent, which was so arranged that the
airship could be easily taken out.</p>

<p>“Here they come!” yelled a score of voices as
the blunt nose of the <i>Comet</i> was seen emerging
from the tent. The lifting power of the gas was
so great that even with all the ballast on, and men
holding the motor ship down, it evinced a tendency
to sail aloft.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll go up, all right,” murmured Mr.
Glassford, a hopeful look coming into his face.
“Get ready, boys. Keep the crowd back, men. I
don’t want any one to get hurt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The ship was now completely out of the tent.
On all sides were heard murmurs of admiration.</p>

<p>“She’s a dandy!” was the general opinion of
the boys in the crowd, while the men could be heard
speaking words of praise.</p>

<p>“Them motor boys do beat the Dutch!” exclaimed
an old resident. “When they had them
there motor cycles I thought that was about as fur
as they’d go, but land o’ Goshen, look at ’em now!
About t’ sail in th’ air like eagles! Well, well,
it’s a great age!”</p>

<p>“That’s a hot airship!” exclaimed Noddy Nixon
to Jack Pender, one of his old-time cronies. “I’ll
bet it won’t go up.”</p>

<p>Little Andy Rush heard what the bully said.</p>

<p>“You wait and see,” he said. “It’ll beat your
tin fly all to pieces.”</p>

<p>“You mind your business,” retorted Noddy, but
he could not conceal his envy at the fine motor
ship which the boys possessed. He disliked them
more than ever.</p>

<p>“You wait here,” Andy heard Noddy say in a
low voice to Jack. “If that thing gets up in the
air, maybe I can make it come down again. Wait
for me.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Jack in a
whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“You wait,” was all Noddy replied. “I’ll get
even with ’em.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll keep my eye on you, Noddy Nixon,”
said Andy to himself. “You’ll bear watching.”</p>

<p>By this time the airship had been taken to a
place whence it was decided to make the ascent.
The crowd was finally induced to stand far enough
back so that the men could get it in position. Mr.
Glassford went all around it, looking for possible
flaws. He seemed to find none.</p>

<p>“Get in, boys,” he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Jerry, Ned and Bob, with rather queer feelings,
entered the car hanging from the <i>Comet</i>. The
car was just off the ground, but by the way the
big gas bag was tugging it would evidently shoot
skyward as soon as the score of men holding it
released their grip and some of the ballast was cast
off.</p>

<p>“Now you, professor,” called the inventor, and
Uriah Snodgrass took his place in the main cabin.</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford climbed into the operating tower.
He tested various wheels and levers. Then he gave
a glance over the whole ship. There was a moment’s
silence, while those in the crowd looked
anxiously on. Were they to see success or failure?</p>

<p>“Let go!” cried Mr. Glassford suddenly.</p>

<p>The men released their holds and leaped back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
An assistant pulled on a cord which released the
necessary number of ballast bags.</p>

<p>Up into the air, like a frightened bird, shot the
<i>Comet</i>. Up and up she went, while to the boys
and the professor it seemed as if the earth, the
crowd and all below them, suddenly dropped away.
To them it was as if they were standing still and
the earth was receding.</p>

<p>“There she goes!” cried the crowd, as if there
was any doubt of it.</p>

<p>Up and up went the <i>Comet</i>, until it was five hundred
feet above the ground. Then it seemed to
come to a stop, for Mr. Glassford had so regulated
the supply of gas and the weight that no great
height would be attained.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stillness all about the ship was
broken by the rattling exhaust as the motor started.
The big propellers began to revolve, whirling
around like streaks of light. Faster and faster
they went.</p>

<p>“We’re moving! We’re moving!” cried Jerry,
looking from a side window in the cabin down toward
the earth.</p>

<p>“I thought we would,” replied Mr. Glassford
quietly.</p>

<p>He began to steer the ship. There was scarcely
any wind, and the <i>Comet</i> moved from right to left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
at will. The inventor went around in a circle, and
cut a figure eight above the heads of the crowd.
Then he descended a little by tilting the elevation
rudder, and when some cried out in fear that he
was dropping upon their heads, he shifted a lever,
and the balloon aeroplane shot upward again. It
seemed to be under perfect control.</p>

<p>All at once, above the rattle of the motor was
heard another sound. The cabin windows were
open, and Jerry heard something whizz past his
ear with a curious, singing tone.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Professor Snodgrass, who
had not said a word since they started, seeming to
take it all as a matter of course. “Is that a new
kind of mosquito? I must catch it. Where is
my net?”</p>

<p>“It sounded more like a bullet,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what it was,” declared Jerry. “A bullet
or a shot. Some one is firing at us!”</p>

<p>He looked down. There seemed to be some commotion
in the crowd. They could hear shouting.</p>

<p>Then came another of those curious, whining,
whizzing sounds. Jerry leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“They’re shooting at us, Mr. Glassford!” he
cried.</p>

<p>At that moment the motor stopped, and the airship
began to descend rapidly.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>NODDY’S PLOT</small></h2>


<p>Instantly there was a commotion aboard the
<i>Comet</i>. The boys started to their feet, and with
fear in their eyes looked forward to where Mr.
Glassford stood in the small pilot house. The airship
continued to descend, but not so rapidly as
before.</p>

<p>“Are we&mdash;is there any danger?” cried Jerry.
“Shall I let go some of the ballast?”</p>

<p>“Not a bagful,” replied the inventor calmly.
“Nothing has happened. One of the chains operating
the propellers has broken, and I stopped the
motor before it could get tangled in the wheels.
Then I let out a little gas to bring us down. We
must make a descent, but there is nothing serious
the matter. I can fix it in half an hour, and we can
go up again.”</p>

<p>“I thought some one had shot a hole in the gas
bag,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“Some one was certainly shooting at us,” added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Ned. “Look down there. Something is the matter.”</p>

<p>There did appear to be some trouble in that portion
of the throng directly below the motor ship.
Men were running about, and loud shouts continued
to be heard.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re afraid we’re falling,” ventured
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Mr. Glassford. “I shall have
to let a little more gas out. I used a rather strong
mixture. But I think I can get down now by using
the depression rudder and shifting the planes.
That will save the gas.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem right that any one should shoot
at us,” said Professor Snodgrass calmly, as if such
a proceeding was even permissible.</p>

<p>“Well, I should say not!” exclaimed Jerry. “If
I find out who it was I’ll make him sorry for it!”</p>

<p>“I think I can almost guess who it was,” said
Bob.</p>

<p>“You mean Noddy Nixon?” asked Ned, and the
stout youth nodded an assent.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was the calmest person
aboard the motor ship. The little accident had
more or less affected Mr. Glassford and the boys,
and the sound of bullets flying uncomfortably close
to the big gas bag had not decreased their nervousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
But the professor continued to survey the
surrounding atmosphere in search of new kinds of
insects. Mr. Glassford had shut the gas outlet
and had so tilted the planes and rudder that the
big ship was approaching the earth on a slant, not
making very rapid progress.</p>

<p>“We’ll land as gently as a feather,” prophesied
Bob as he looked over the side.</p>

<p>“That’s my intention,” replied Mr. Glassford
with a smile. “It doesn’t do to come down with
a thump, you know. An airship, at best, as yet, is
rather a delicate piece of machinery. I am sorry
this accident happened, but it is better to discover
the defects now than later.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was soon resting on the ground,
ready hands catching hold of the retaining ropes
and making them fast to stakes driven into the
earth for that purpose, while bags of sand, that
had been detached when the ascent was made, were
again fastened on to make up for the weight of the
travelers, who alighted amid the cheers of the
throng.</p>

<p>“Well, ye done it, all right,” cried an old man,
as he tried to shake hands with Mr. Glassford, the
boys and Professor Snodgrass all at the same time.
“Land o’ Goshen, but ye done it! I never thought
ye would.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, we made a fairly successful flight,” replied
Mr. Glassford. “But for a slight accident we
would have stayed up much longer.”</p>

<p>“An accident!” exclaimed a tall youth, stepping
forward. “Tell me about it, please. I’m a reporter
from the Boston <i>Globe</i>, sent out here to
get an account of this.”</p>

<p>“One of the propeller transmission chains
broke,” said Mr. Glassford, and he proceeded to
explain to the newspaper man what had happened.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the motor boys were surrounded
by an admiring throng. Some of their young acquaintances
clearly regarded them as heroes of
the very highest type. The boys’ parents were
amid the throng, but as soon as they learned that
everything had gone off comparatively safely, they
departed, for the crowd was increasing all the
while.</p>

<p>Andy Rush pushed his way through the press of
people and called to Jerry:</p>

<p>“Did any of the shot hit you?”</p>

<p>“Shot? Then some one was firing at us!” exclaimed
Jerry. “Who was it, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!” replied the small chap. “He
had a big airgun, and when you got up in the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
he hid behind a tree and popped at you. I saw him,
and I told him I’d tell you. Did he hit you?”</p>

<p>“No, but he came near it. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Over there somewhere, I guess,” and Andy
pointed to a clump of trees.</p>

<p>“I’ll settle his hash!” exclaimed Jerry, righteously
wrathful. “Come on, fellows.”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass had seen a new kind of
bug as soon as he alighted from the car, and he
was oblivious to everything else. Mr. Glassford
was talking to the reporter, and in the eagerness
to see the motor ship no one paid much attention
to the three lads, who, led by Andy, started off to
find the bully.</p>

<p>They caught sight of Noddy standing behind
a big tree, and before he realized it the motor
boys had surrounded him.</p>

<p>“Look here!” cried Jerry, “why did you shoot
at us?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t shoot at you.”</p>

<p>“You did so!” cried Andy. “I saw you!”</p>

<p>“Aw, dry up!” exclaimed Noddy. “How could
I shoot? I ain’t got no gun.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t, eh? What’s this?” asked Ned,
suddenly pushing Noddy to one side and disclosing
the fact that a powerful air-rifle was standing upright
between the bully and the tree. Noddy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
hoped that it would not be seen, as, after his dastardly
trick, he had not dared to leave the grounds
carrying the weapon.</p>

<p>For an instant following the discovery Noddy
did not know what to say. Then he blurted out:</p>

<p>“That isn’t mine! I didn’t do any shooting with
it.”</p>

<p>Jerry, who was standing near the bully, caught
hold of his hand. The fingers were black.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s evidence enough,” he said quietly.
“Your hands are all black from handling lead
shot, Noddy. We’ve got you with the goods!”</p>

<p>“And I saw him shoot,” went on Andy. “I saw
him aiming at you, and I yelled at him, but he
wouldn’t stop. He fired a couple of times, and I
was just going after a constable to arrest him,
when something seemed to happen to the airship,
and the crowd began to yell. I thought sure he’d
put a hole in you.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s face showed the anger he felt. The other
boys, too, looked as if they would like to thrash
Noddy.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I didn’t mean to shoot at you,” whined the
bully, seeing that he was fairly cornered. “I was
shooting at some birds and&mdash;and&mdash;maybe the bullets
went too close to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should think they did go too close,” commented
Ned. “You ought to be arrested for this.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” asked one of several men,
who had approached the group of lads.</p>

<p>“He tried to puncture the balloon bag with his
airgun, that’s what he did,” declared Andy. “I
saw him. He’s mad because this airship works,
and his tin fly didn’t.”</p>

<p>“He ought to be sent to jail,” declared one of
the men, a long-time resident of Cresville. “It’s
a disgrace to the community to have such a fellow
in it. Instead of feeling jealous that this ship
worked he ought to be proud of the distinction that
has come to our town. Where’s a constable? We’ll
have him arrested!”</p>

<p>“Don’t any of you try to arrest me!” cried
Noddy savagely. “I’ll shoot any one who touches
me,” and he caught up his air-rifle.</p>

<p>His threat was mere bravado, for he was too
great a coward to attempt any such thing as that.
But no one liked to run the risk of the gun going
off, perhaps accidentally, in the hands of the now
thoroughly frightened youth. So they made no
move to molest him as he sneaked away.</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself!” cried
the man who had championed the cause of the
motor boys. “If I see you around here when any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
more tests are going on I’ll take you to the lockup
myself.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to get him arrested when I first saw
what he was up to,” went on Andy, “but when I
yelled to the crowd about what he was doing,
every one was so excited about you sailing along
in the air that I couldn’t make myself understood.”</p>

<p>“I guess the crowd wasn’t to blame, for if you
talked as fast as you usually do when you’re excited
they couldn’t make head or tail of what you said.
But you’re all right, Andy, even if you do use a
little too much gasolene once in a while. We’re
much obliged to you. You can take a trip with
us next time.”</p>

<p>“Can I, really? That’s the stuff&mdash;up in the air&mdash;among
the clouds&mdash;beat the birds&mdash;sail with the
wind&mdash;down again&mdash;up once more&mdash;over the
hills&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” cried Ned. “You’ve done enough
for one day, Andy. Now, boys, let’s go back and
see how Mr. Glassford is making out.”</p>

<p>They found the inventor finishing his interview
with the reporter, and soon the motor ship was
back in the tent, from which the crowd was excluded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Noddy Nixon, filled with unreasoning
wrath, both at the success of his rivals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
over the fact that he had been discovered in his
mean trick, was walking slowly through the fields,
carrying his airgun. He did not notice a man approaching
him, and was somewhat startled when
the stranger remarked:</p>

<p>“Didn’t I see you shooting at the airship?”</p>

<p>“N-no&mdash;I&mdash;I wasn’t shooting,” stammered
Noddy, thinking the man was a constable sent after
him.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you were,” went on the man quietly.
“I saw you,” and he seemed so positive that Noddy
did not deny it again. “But don’t worry,” the
stranger continued. “I’m not going to inform on
you. I presume you must have had some motive
in trying to puncture the gas bag.”</p>

<p>“I hate those fellows!” burst out Noddy.
“They’re enemies of mine, and are always making
trouble for me,” which was very far from the truth,
as you readers who know Noddy of old can testify.</p>

<p>“Ah, then you haven’t any love for them,” went
on the man.</p>

<p>“I guess not.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t, either,” spoke the man vindictively.</p>

<p>“Why, do you know the motor boys?”</p>

<p>“No, but I have a very good reason to know that
fellow Glassford, and, while of course I wouldn’t
want to see him or the boys hurt, I’d like to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
even with him for what he did to me. That’s why
I was interested in your attempt to put a hole in
the gas bag.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had,” muttered Noddy.</p>

<p>“So do I. But maybe we can get square with
him in another way.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean? What have you got against
him?”</p>

<p>“Plenty. I used to work for Glassford, but he
discharged me after stealing my plans for the airship&mdash;this
same ship he sailed in to-day.”</p>

<p>“Was that ship built on your plans?” asked
Noddy quickly.</p>

<p>“It certainly was. I am the inventor of it, not
Glassford. My name is Giles Hoswell.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you sue him and make him give
you back the plans?”</p>

<p>“Because I can’t afford it. I am a poor man,
and he evidently has plenty of money.”</p>

<p>“Not much. Jerry Hopkins and his chums furnished
the cash to build this airship.”</p>

<p>“Yes, on my plans,” went on Hoswell bitterly.</p>

<p>“Would you like to get your plans back?” asked
Noddy.</p>

<p>“Of course, but what’s the use talking about
that? I don’t stand any chance. I haven’t any
money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you prove that those plans are yours?”</p>

<p>“I certainly can.”</p>

<p>“And if you could, do you suppose you could
make him give up the airship?”</p>

<p>“I think so. But why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because I’m going to help you get your plans
back and take the ship away from them!” exclaimed
Noddy. “My father has plenty of money,
and I know he’ll aid you. Come with me. I’ll
get even with the motor boys this time, I guess.”
And chuckling with evil glee, Noddy led his new
acquaintance over the fields.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>A SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT</small></h2>


<p>“Well, boys,” remarked Mr. Glassford as the
flap of the tent was closed on the curious crowd
that surged forward, “are you satisfied with the
ship?”</p>

<p>“We sure are,” answered Jerry. “It did better
than I thought it would.”</p>

<p>“Even if we did have an accident,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“That accident was nothing,” declared Mr.
Glassford. “It showed that even when one does
happen we are as safe in the upper air as we are
on the earth. But I think I will change the propellers.
I want to make them four-bladed. That
will give us more power, and our motor will stand
it. We can then navigate against a pretty strong
wind.”</p>

<p>“How long will it take?” asked Bob. “I’m
anxious to go up again.”</p>

<p>“About two days. Then we’ll try another flight.
I think we can take a little heavier load, too.”</p>

<p>“Then can I go along?” asked Andy eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re not much of a load, but I guess you can
go,” spoke Jerry. “Well, I guess we can now
call ourselves balloonists, aeroplanists or whatever
is the proper title. We’ve made our first flight.”</p>

<p>“And it won’t be the last,” added Ned. “This
is better than any of the machines did at the Broadlands
exhibition.”</p>

<p>“I told you I could build a better ship than any
they had there,” remarked Mr. Glassford quietly.
“Well, boys, suppose we get right to work on the
new propellers.”</p>

<p>They lost no time, and having the material on
hand were able in two days to fit them to the shafts.
The broken chain was mended, and the motor ship
<i>Comet</i> was ready for another flight. No announcement
was made of it, as they wished to avoid attracting
a crowd, but the news spread in some manner&mdash;perhaps
Andy Rush couldn’t keep quiet about
his part in it&mdash;and there was quite a gathering
when once more the big machine shot toward the
sky.</p>

<p>“This is&mdash;this is glorious!” cried Andy as he
sat in the little cabin with the boys and watched the
earth dropping away from beneath them.</p>

<p>“Now don’t get excited and talk fast, or you
might heat a journal bearing and set fire to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
gas in the bag,” cautioned Jerry. “You have to be
careful aboard a motor ship, Andy.”</p>

<p>“I will. But this is certainly great!”</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford now started the motor from the
pilot tower where he was, and the <i>Comet</i> shot forward.
It certainly went faster and better with the
large propellers, and made fine progress against
rather a stiff breeze. The ship was under perfect
control, and Mr. Glassford was able to direct it up
or down, to right or left, or around in big circles
as suited his fancy.</p>

<p>“Marvelous! marvelous!” cried Professor Snodgrass.
“It is wonderful what strides science is
making these days. Now, if I could only see some
of the rare insects which I know must live in the
regions of the upper air I would be perfectly
happy.”</p>

<p>“There’s some sort of a bug!” exclaimed Andy,
pointing to a small black object sailing through the
air. “Maybe that is a new kind.”</p>

<p>Instantly the professor was all attention. He
leaped to his feet, and with his small, long-handled
net in readiness he watched the progress of the
large insect.</p>

<p>“It is a new kind of June bug,” he announced.
“Very large, and with green and red wings. Oh,
I must have that! It is worth considerable. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
museum in America has one, and there are only a
few specimens in Europe. It is rather late for June
bugs to be flying, though. Could you put the ship
a little more to the left, Mr. Glassford? I want
to catch him.”</p>

<p>“That’s something new&mdash;using a big motor ship
to catch a June bug,” remarked the inventor with a
smile. But he shifted the fish-tail rudder, and the
<i>Comet</i> obediently swerved over closer to the big,
humming June bug.</p>

<p>But the insect apparently did not like the strange,
big white-winged creature that was coming so
close, and it made a sudden dart upward.</p>

<p>“After it!” cried the professor. “I must have
it!”</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford tilted the ascending rudder so as
to pull the ship upward, and it answered instantly,
shooting toward the sky on an angle of about
twenty degrees. This time the bug did not
change its course.</p>

<p>The professor hurried aft to a little cockpit, in
which the motor was located. As he did so the
bug shifted its course, and took a position just
above, and a little ahead of the pilot house. There
it remained, keeping up a speed equal to that of
the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Don’t move, now! Don’t frighten it! I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
have him in a minute!” cried the scientist, hurrying
forward. He mounted to the top of the small
pilot house, right under the elevation rudder, and
then thrust out his long-handled net. He had
the small cord bag almost over the flying June bug
when something happened.</p>

<p>The net was whirled from the professor’s grasp
as if a giant had plucked it from him, and then it
was sent over the side of the ship and down toward
the earth. At the same instant there was a crash
of wood, and the port propeller ceased revolving.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” cried Jerry excitedly.</p>

<p>“The professor got his net in the way of the
flying blades,” explained Mr. Glassford as he
quickly shut off the motor to see what damage had
been done.</p>

<p>“There goes the bug,” said the scientist sorrowfully,
as if that was all that mattered.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there goes your net,” added Ned.
“I hope it doesn’t hit any one down on the earth.
That’s one disadvantage of living down there,” he
went on. “You’re liable to be struck with things
falling from airships.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I hope I haven’t damaged the craft,” spoke
the professor contritely when he realized what had
happened.</p>

<p>“Nothing but what can easily be repaired,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Mr. Glassford. “The net handle must have broken,
and a piece of it has become wedged in the sprocket
chain that operates the propeller. I will ungear
that one, and we’ll see what we can do by simply
using the other. It will be a good test.”</p>

<p>The inventor seemed to take advantage of every
accident, the boys thought. He started the motor
again, and though the ship did not make as much
speed as before, it sailed along fairly well. The
slight tendency to go around in a circle, caused by
using only one propeller, was counterbalanced by
changing some of the planes, and they made a flight
of a mile or more, sailing in various directions.</p>

<p>“Now I want you boys to get acquainted with the
mechanism,” said Mr. Glassford. “You must take
turns steering and managing the ship. Jerry, suppose
you begin. Come up here in the pilot house
and I’ll initiate you.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s knowledge of an automobile stood him
in good stead, though he found that the <i>Comet</i>
answered her rudders much more readily and quickly
than did the auto or a motor boat. When Jerry
had been taught the use of all the wheels, levers
and appliances, it was the turn of Ned and then of
Bob.</p>

<p>While his chums were learning how to steer
Jerry took a walk all around the craft. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
peered over the side, thinking he saw something
dangling underneath.</p>

<p>It was a rope, with a stake attached, and he
bent over to haul it in. He had just accomplished
this when he uttered a cry of dismay:</p>

<p>“There it goes!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Bob, who was approaching.</p>

<p>“My pocketbook! It just dropped out of my
pocket.”</p>

<p>“Did you have much in it?”</p>

<p>“About a hundred and fifty dollars. I was going
to pay some bills for mother after we came
down.”</p>

<p>“Too bad! Did you see where it landed?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Nobody on the airship could do anything for
Jerry. All were sorry over his loss.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll get it back,” said Mr. Glassford.
“Did it have your name and address in it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I think it dropped in a woods. Nobody
would be likely to find it there,” returned the
unfortunate youth.</p>

<p>They had been up in the air several hours now,
and the thrill of skimming along almost on a level
with the clouds was wonderful. They did not want
to descend. Professor Snodgrass was not enjoying
himself, however, as he saw many curious insects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and as he had no other net with him he could not
catch any of the winged creatures.</p>

<p>“Can’t you drop down, get my net, and come
back again?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll go down, but I don’t want to make
another ascension until I have repaired the propeller,”
said Mr. Glassford. “Though I’m afraid
we’d have quite a task to locate your net.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, I have several more. I’ll bring
two along next time.”</p>

<p>“But please don’t get them twisted up in the
propeller,” begged Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’ll not.”</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford, who had resumed charge of the
ship, now sent it down to the earth in a long slant.
They had returned to a position over their tent,
around which quite a crowd was now collected.</p>

<p>“It certainly is a great ship,” commented Ned.
“I wish there was another aero carnival. We
could enter it, and I’ll bet we could beat anything
they had.”</p>

<p>“There’s going to be a big airship carnival next
month, boys,” said Andy Rush, who seemed to
keep abreast of aeronautic matters. “I was reading
about it last night.”</p>

<p>“There is? Where?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Out at Park Haven, Indiana. It’s an inter-State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
airship contest. It’s going to be the biggest
affair of the kind ever held, and there are several
prizes offered.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with our entering the
<i>Comet</i>?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Nothing, I guess,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you can’t,” added Mr. Glassford.
“We will have a chance before then to
eliminate all the defects, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s do it!” cried Jerry eagerly. “We’ll
go in a race, and maybe we’ll win.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why we can’t,” observed Bob. “The
<i>Comet</i> is a dandy.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, find out more particulars, and we’ll
consider it,” said Mr. Glassford as he steered the
ship down to a smooth place in front of the tent,
after a most successful flight, in spite of the small
accident.</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums went out on a long hunt for
the lost pocketbook, but without success.</p>

<p>“Advertise for it,” said Chunky. “I’d offer a
reward.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Jerry, and he was as good as his
word.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>A PERILOUS TRIP</small></h2>


<p>It did not take long to repair the propeller damaged
by Professor Snodgrass, but Mr. Glassford,
though the boys asked him to do so, did not make
a trip the next day. He said he wanted to make
some slight changes in the elevation rudder, and
there were also some other small parts of the
<i>Comet</i> that needed adjusting.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, however, Andy Rush had
found the paper in which he had read an account
of the coming carnival at Park Haven, and the
boys eagerly went over the details.</p>

<p>“Why, there are two main prizes,” announced
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Two? How’s that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“One for the motor ship making the longest
flight, and the other for the one remaining in the
air the longest time.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can win both!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Go on, don’t be greedy!” was Ned’s rebuke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
“But what are the conditions? Can dirigible balloons
and aeroplanes enter?”</p>

<p>“It seems so from this,” replied Jerry as he went
over the conditions of the race. “Any kind of an
airship, lighter or heavier than air, can compete.
There are also prizes for the largest ship, and for
the smallest, and for the oddest one.”</p>

<p>“Noddy ought to have saved his <i>Firefly</i> for this
exhibit,” commented Professor Snodgrass, who had
been told of the happenings at Broadlands.</p>

<p>“There’s one machine queerer than his,” said
Ned. “That is Mr. Abernot’s flying grasshopper.
Maybe that will be out there.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get busy and see if we can enter
our ship,” proposed Jerry. “I’ll write to the secretary
of the committee that is in charge, and get
some entry blanks.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” remarked Bob. “I think I’ll go
home and get some lunch,” for the boys were in
the airship tent, where they spent most of their
time.</p>

<p>“That’s the first time I’ve heard Chunky mention
eating since we got the motor ship fever,”
said Ned. “You must be getting tired of the
<i>Comet</i>, Bob.”</p>

<p>“I am not, but can’t a fellow get hungry once in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a while? I noticed you filling up on two ice cream
sodas this morning, all right and ditto.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was hot,” pleaded Ned.</p>

<p>“Here, you two stop scrapping,” commanded
Jerry. “We don’t want any hot air where there’s
so much hydrogen gas around.”</p>

<p>A few days later, one or two successful flights
having been made in the meanwhile, Jerry received
an answer from the secretary of the Park Haven
Aero Club, enclosing entry blanks. The motor
boys, finding the conditions to their liking, lost no
time in entering the <i>Comet</i> in the coming races.</p>

<p>“Now, if we’re going in them,” stipulated Mr.
Glassford, “we want to win one prize, at least. I
think we had better have a longer and higher experimental
flight than any we have yet undertaken.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Me for an all-day sojourn in the clouds!” cried
Bob. “We’ll take our dinner along, though,” he
added hastily, while his two chums laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it would be a good idea to take
lunch with us,” said Mr. Glassford. “We’ll
imagine we are on a long trip to win a prize, and
we’ll have a good chance to see how our ship behaves.”</p>

<p>Two days later, having taken aboard what Ned
and Jerry considered was entirely too much food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
but which Bob declared was barely a sufficiency, the
<i>Comet</i> made another ascension. Some changes
had been made in the planes and rudder, and the
good effect was at once noticeable. The ship could
more readily be sent aloft or deflected toward the
earth.</p>

<p>“I think I’ve got her pretty nearly right now,”
said Mr. Glassford. “She goes better than ever,
for I have made improvements in my plans. Well,
I’ll send her up about a mile.”</p>

<p>This was higher than the boys had ever been,
and at first they experienced some difficulty in
breathing. But they soon became used to the
rarefied atmosphere, and then Mr. Glassford tilted
the rudder still more.</p>

<p>“Going higher?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“We might as well. I’d like to get above the
clouds and see how she works in very thin air.
There’s a low stratum of vapor over there,” and he
pointed ahead of them. “Are you boys in any distress?”</p>

<p>“No, we can stand it,” declared Bob. “Go
ahead.”</p>

<p>A little later the <i>Comet</i> was above the clouds,
and looking down from the cabin windows the
motor boys saw below them a fleecy mass of vapor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that rolled and twisted this way and that, as the
ship sped across its upper expanse.</p>

<p>“There’s a bug!” suddenly exclaimed the professor,
making a hasty grab for his net. He succeeded
in extending it without accident, and a moment
later he had captured a curious insect which
seemed to give him great pleasure.</p>

<p>“My first specimen of insect life above the
clouds!” he cried. “I shall devote a whole chapter
to it in my new book, with a full-page drawing of
it. This seems a very rare specimen. I never saw
one like it down on the earth. It is most fortunate
that you boys have this motor ship. It is destined
to be a great help to the cause of science.”</p>

<p>“Here are a lot more bugs,” cried Ned, pointing
to a cloud of insects that were hovering on his
side of the ship.</p>

<p>“Where&mdash;where? Let me get at them!” cried
the professor, putting away the first one he had
caught. He extended his net and caught hundreds
of specimens, for there was a small cloud of the
things. He drew them close to him and peered
at them through his large spectacles.</p>

<p>“Mosquitoes!” he exclaimed in great disgust.
“Ordinary, common mosquitoes!”</p>

<p>“Kill them!” cried Bob. “If they’re like any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that bit me last night they’ll bore a hole through the
gas bag. Kill them, professor!”</p>

<p>But the scientist reversed his net and let the
little pests go. He was more successful a little
later, capturing what he said were some rare insects,
but which the boys thought were the most
common bugs. But, then, you see, they were not
scientists.</p>

<p>The earth was now out of sight, and all that
could be seen were masses of cloudy vapor. On
and on sped the ship, the great propellers pulling
it ahead at swift speed. Nor did a stiff breeze
which they encountered high in the air serve to
turn the <i>Comet</i> from her course. The ship was
proceeding most successfully.</p>

<p>Several hours passed, and after a glance at the
recording instruments, of which there were several
in the pilot house, Mr. Glassford announced that
they had traveled seventy-five miles.</p>

<p>“And in about two hours,” added Bob. “That’s
great sailing.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do better than that,” prophesied Mr.
Glassford. “Here, Jerry, suppose you take charge
a while. I’ll come back in the cabin.”</p>

<p>Not without a little feeling of nervousness did
Jerry take his place in the pilot house. But he had
profited by the lessons of the inventor, and soon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to show his control of the ship, he sent her up and
down, and to right and left.</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Mr. Glassford. “You’ll do.”</p>

<p>In turn Ned and Bob steered, but when it was
suggested that Professor Snodgrass try his hand he
balked.</p>

<p>“My business is to catch insects for science,” he
said. “I did enough damage when I disarranged
the propeller. I’m not going to risk it again.”</p>

<p>They had lunch high in the air, a most novel
experience for them, though Bob was not affected
by it and ate as heartily as if he was on the earth,
according to his two chums.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve made a hundred and fifty miles
since we started,” announced Mr. Glassford a little
later. “I think that demonstrates what we can do.
Suppose we turn back?”</p>

<p>“That suits me,” said Jerry. “The folks may
be worried about us.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, the <i>Comet</i> was put about and headed
for Cresville. The speed at once increased, as
she had the benefit of a stiff breeze to aid her.</p>

<p>They had sped along for perhaps fifty miles
when the billowy, white mass of clouds above which
they were sailing gave place to a broad expanse of
clear atmosphere. The brightly shining sun struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
full upon them, and they could see the green earth
spread out below.</p>

<p>“Ah, this is something like!” cried Bob. “This
is fine! Eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken when they were all aware
that the <i>Comet</i>, which had been proceeding along
on the level, was shooting upward very swiftly.
At the same moment Mr. Glassford uttered a
cry, and the boys saw him rapidly turning a wheel
valve.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The heat of the sun is expanding our gas and
causing us to rise,” explained the inventor. “I
must let some out, as I don’t want to go any
higher.”</p>

<p>But something seemed to be the matter. Mr.
Glassford could not open the gas valve, and the
motor ship continued to rise.</p>

<p>“I must try the deflecting rudder,” he murmured.
“Jerry, come and give me a hand.”</p>

<p>Jerry hurried forward. The pressure on the
oblong planes which constituted the deflecting rudder
was very great. It required the combined
strength of the inventor and Jerry to move the
lever a slight distance. And it was only a slight
distance that they could move it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Something is jammed!” exclaimed Mr. Glassford.
“We can’t move the rudder!”</p>

<p>“And we can’t let the gas out,” said Jerry in a
low voice. “What’s going to happen?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go on up&mdash;until&mdash;until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford did not finish.</p>

<p>“My head feels queer!” cried Bob, staggering
about the cabin. “I feel dizzy.” And before
Ned, who was standing near him, could grasp his
chum, Bob had fallen upon the floor of the car.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>STARTING FOR THE RACE</small></h2>


<p>“Go back to him, Jerry,” cried Mr. Glassford,
observing from the pilot house what had happened.
“Tell him to swallow several mouthfuls of water.
That will equalize the pressure on his ear-drums,
which is what makes him feel so badly. We are
up rather high, and still ascending.”</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums had been told how to conduct
themselves in case of emergency in high altitudes,
and though when he reached the place where
Bob was stretched out in great distress he found
Ned about to succumb to the rarefied atmosphere,
Jerry did not lose his head. He procured water
from a tank, made both lads swallow some, and
then, with the aid of Professor Snodgrass, administered
a few simple remedies. Ned and Bob soon
felt better.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, neither Jerry nor the professor
were affected by the height to which the
<i>Comet</i> had now shot. As for Mr. Glassford, he
had made too many balloon ascensions to mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
being a few miles up in the air. His principal
anxiety was now regarding the mechanism of the
motor ship.</p>

<p>Work as desperately as he did, and pull as hard
as was safe on the lever that shifted the rudder
controlling the height, nothing resulted from it.
Nor could he open the valve that held the gas in
the big bag.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to try some other means of getting
down,” declared Mr. Glassford.</p>

<p>“Maybe the sun will soon stop expanding the
gas,” ventured Bob, who was now feeling much
better.</p>

<p>“Yes, that will happen shortly, as it is setting;
but I must stop our upward flight more quickly
than that.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you stop the motor?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Because while we are in motion it rides on a
more even keel, and is less subject to air currents.
I must climb out forward and ungear the elevation
rudder.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that dangerous?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been in safer places, and I’ve done
more risky things. I’ve got to take a chance.”</p>

<p>Then, almost as suddenly as they had emerged
into the open, sun-lit space, which was responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for much of their trouble, the travelers found themselves
enveloped in a mist.</p>

<p>“We’re in the clouds again!” exclaimed Mr.
Glassford. “That ought to put a stop to our
rising.”</p>

<p>He ran forward and looked at the instrument
for indicating the height.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve stopped,” he announced. “We’re
stationary, as far as going up or down is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Bur-r-r-r!” exclaimed Bob with a shiver. “It’s
getting cold!”</p>

<p>It was very chilly, and they had brought along
no wraps to protect them from the frostiness of
the upper air. It had been ninety in the shade
when they started from the earth.</p>

<p>“Go into the cabin,” advised Mr. Glassford.
“Shut the doors and windows. That will keep you
somewhat warm.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m going to shift that rudder,” announced the
inventor firmly. “We’ve got to descend, and I
don’t dare risk meddling too much with the gas
valve, for fear I will break it, and all the gas will
rush out too quickly. I must have a duplicate valve
for just such emergencies as this.”</p>

<p>Jerry saw that it would be best to let Mr. Glassford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
manage things his own way, so with his two
chums and Professor Snodgrass he retired to the
main cabin, where, with doors and windows closed,
there was some protection from the cold.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Bob suddenly. “It’s snowing!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, looking out of the windows they
all saw a whirling cloud of white crystals, blowing
this way and that as they sailed through them.</p>

<p>“A very common phenomenon,” remarked the
professor. “It is caused by moist air coming suddenly
in contact with a cool stratum, which caused it
to condense below the dew point, thus producing
rain or snow, as the case may be. But if there
aren’t some new kind of insects! I must have them
for my collection.”</p>

<p>No danger was ever too great to deter the professor
from collecting specimens. However, this
time it was impossible to get them, as when he
opened the door such a rush of cold air met him
as caused him to turn back.</p>

<p>“One needs an overcoat here,” he declared.</p>

<p>“I should say so,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, I must risk it,” went on the professor.
“I simply must have those insects.”</p>

<p>“You’re too late,” said Jerry. “We’ve passed
them.”</p>

<p>This was so, for the <i>Comet</i> had shot beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
little cloud of creatures that were flying about in a
snowstorm. The professor, with a sigh, gave up
his plan and returned to the cabin window.</p>

<p>“We’re going down!” cried Ned quickly. “Mr.
Glassford must have fixed the rudder.”</p>

<p>The airship was descending. In a little while
they were sensible that it was much warmer, and
they could open the cabin. They found the inventor
in the pilot house, rubbing his hands to restore
the circulation, which had been impeded by the
cold.</p>

<p>“Are we all right?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Fairly so. I can’t operate the gas valve, but I
think by deflecting the rudder sufficiently and by
waiting until after sundown, we can reach the
earth. The gas is rapidly cooling off. The rudder
was jammed. I released it, and now it works all
right.”</p>

<p>“It’s getting late,” observed Bob. “Where are
we?”</p>

<p>“About seventy miles from home,” announced
the inventor. “I think we’ll get there some time
to-night. I will speed up the motor as soon as we
get a little lower.”</p>

<p>They were now below the clouds, and they could
see that the sun had set. It rapidly became darker,
but Mr. Glassford had a compass and a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
sense of direction, so he kept on, confident that he
would reach Cresville. The stars came out overhead,
and all below the travelers was blackness,
with here and there lights showing as they passed
over some village or city.</p>

<p>“We’re about eight hundred feet above the earth
now,” announced Mr. Glassford after a pause. “I
think we’ll stay there until we get where we can
make a landing.”</p>

<p>“We might as well eat, I suppose,” proposed
Bob after a pause. “It’s supper time, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were too frightened to eat,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I was, but I’m over it now. I’ll get the grub.”</p>

<p>Chunky set out what was left of the provisions
they had brought, and the food was very acceptable,
Jerry taking some in spite of the fun he made
of Bob.</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford speeded up the motor, and the
<i>Comet</i> sailed along faster than before. It was
about nine o’clock when they reached Cresville, and
a landing was made without accident.</p>

<p>They found quite a crowd waiting for them, for
it was known that they had gone off on a long trip,
and when the ship was not back at the tent at
dusk much alarm was felt. The boys found their
parents in the throng, and though the lads made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
light of what had happened, they were very thankful
to be safely back on earth again.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve proved that we can make a long
trip and get back in spite of accidents,” said Mr.
Glassford. “We’ll soon be ready for the great race.”</p>

<p>The next two weeks were spent in making some
changes to the motor ship, providing duplicate gas
valves and taking all the precautions to prevent a
recurrence of the former troubles. A large gasolene
tank was put aboard, to hold the fluid necessary
to run the engine for many hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess everything is in good shape,”
announced Mr. Glassford one day, following a
rather long flight, when everything worked perfectly.
“We’ll ship the <i>Comet</i> to Park Haven to-morrow,
and then we’ll go there ourselves to take
part in the great race.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll go along, too,” announced Professor
Snodgrass. “I haven’t half enough insects for my
collection yet, and I want more.”</p>

<p>The next morning, the motor ship having been
taken apart for transportation, it was sent on to
Indiana, whither the boys, Mr. Glassford and Professor
Snodgrass also went.</p>

<p>And though they did not know it, there followed
them, on the next train, Noddy Nixon and Giles
Hoswell.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>HELD UP</small></h2>


<p>The boys and their two friends reached Park
Haven at noon of a very warm day, and at once
went to a hotel where they had engaged rooms.
They found the city well filled with visitors, and
on every side was heard talk concerning balloons
and aeroplanes.</p>

<p>Park Haven was a large city, a junction place
for several railroads, and located right on the edge
of a stretch of level country which made an ideal
place for airship trials. Not that all the contests
would be limited to an area about the city, for it
was hoped that some of the machines would sail
many hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re here,” announced Jerry, after he
and his friends had made themselves comfortable.
“Now, the next thing is to find out when our motor
ship will arrive.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” put in Ned. “Let’s go to the express
office and inquire.”</p>

<p>They found the express agent in anything but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
an amiable frame of mind, for so many articles
were arriving, due to the holding of the carnival
in the city, that he had more than he could attend
to. He could give the boys no information about
the <i>Comet</i>, but as it had been well packed they
were not worried about it, and there was no special
hurry, as the carnival would not formally open for
several days.</p>

<p>They spent the next two days visiting scenes of
interest in the city, and in going out to the carnival
grounds, which were like those at Broadlands, only
on a more elaborate scale.</p>

<p>One of the first persons they met was Morris
Abernot, who greeted them with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Ah, you boys here, too,” he said. “I am glad
to see that you take an interest in aeronautics.”</p>

<p>“We do more than take an interest in them,”
said Jerry. “We have an entry.”</p>

<p>“No! You don’t tell me! Well, I am very
glad.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have your flying grasshopper
here,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Indeed I have, and it is better than ever. I did
not fly very far in it before, as one of the wings
broke, but I have improved it, and I expect to win
a prize. Excuse me now, I must go and see about
it,” and the little man hurried off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“Every one who builds an airship seems to feel
sure it will work, and that he will win a prize,”
remarked Ned. “I wonder if we are too confident?”</p>

<p>“Well, we know ours will fly,” said Jerry.
“Whether it will win a prize is another matter. I
wish it would come. It’s time it arrived.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and make some more inquiries,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to bother that agent,” said Ned.
“He has so much to do that he’s as cross as one
bear and another one.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to find out,” announced Jerry.
“Come on.”</p>

<p>They found the agent seated at a desk, which
was so thickly covered with papers that nothing
could be seen of the desk itself.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know anything about your airship
<i>Comet</i>,” fairly snapped the agent. “There’s no
use asking me. All the express and fast freight
stuff is delayed. There’s a <i>Meteor</i> missing, and
a <i>Dog Star</i>, a <i>Cyclone</i>, a <i>North Wind</i> and a
<i>Hurricane</i>. All of ’em airships&mdash;or what passes
for ’em. I’ll send out a tracer for yours. Come
in the morning. Don’t worry. You’ll get it all
right.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we want to have some practice before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the race,” said Jerry. “Well, do the best you can
for us.”</p>

<p>In the morning the boys learned that their motor
ship would arrive that evening, and they felt much
relieved. Mr. Glassford had not become worried,
but had spent his time renewing his acquaintance
with balloonists and airship men, who were now
thronging into Park Haven.</p>

<p>As for Professor Snodgrass, he was at home in
any place. Give him his insect net and not interfere
with him, and he asked nothing better. He
roamed about the city and out at the carnival
grounds, making capture after capture.</p>

<p>The motor ship arrived that evening and Mr.
Glassford had men in readiness to transport it to
the grounds. A large tent had been set aside for
the use of the owners of the <i>Comet</i>, this being included
in their entry fee.</p>

<p>“We’ll start putting it together in the morning,”
said Mr. Glassford, when the last box had been
brought from the railroad station. “Then we’ll
have some trial trips. I hope it works as well here
as it did in Cresville.”</p>

<p>The next few days were strenuous ones, for it
was no light task to assemble the airship, though
Mr. Glassford hired several men to aid him and
the boys. But at length it was once more together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
looking as it had under the canvas at Cresville.
All that remained was to inflate the big bag, and
this Mr. Glassford at once arranged to do.</p>

<p>“She isn’t damaged a particle,” he said as he
went over the machinery inch by inch. “She’s as
good as she was when we first made her. We can
make a trip to-morrow. I’ll generate gas all night
to-night.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, exhibits were constantly arriving at
the carnival grounds, and the place was beginning
to assume a gala appearance, while from the explosions
of motors in the various tents and buildings,
as the inventors tried out their machines,
it sounded as if a battle was in progress.</p>

<p>The boys hardly ate any breakfast the next morning,
so eager were they to make another trip in
their airship. They hurried down to the tent,
where Mr. Glassford had remained all night, superintending
the making of the gas.</p>

<p>“Is it all right?” asked Jerry eagerly.</p>

<p>“Seems to be,” was the inventor’s reply. “Are
you ready to go up?”</p>

<p>“Whenever you are.”</p>

<p>A little later, with Professor Snodgrass accompanying
them, they made a flight. The scientist
paid no attention to the plaudits of the crowd that
eagerly gathered to see one of the first ships to attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
a flight. Mr. Snodgrass had no time for
such matters. He was looking eagerly for a new
kind of bug.</p>

<p>They made a flight of about two miles, ascending
to a height of several hundred feet, but to
Professor Snodgrass’s great disappointment the
only specimen he caught was a snapping bug, which
he threw away in disgust, as he already had enough
of them in his collection.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Mr. Glassford as he prepared
to descend, “I guess we’re in good shape for the
race. We’ll go all over the ship to-morrow, tighten
her up and stiffen her a bit, and then we’ll be ready
for the word to start.”</p>

<p>They made a beautiful descent, right in front
of their tent, and soon the <i>Comet</i> was housed under
the canvas. As Mr. Glassford, the professor and
the boys were about to come away, leaving a watchman
on guard, a man stepped up to Mr. Glassford,
held out a paper, and asked:</p>

<p>“Are you Rupert Glassford?”</p>

<p>“That’s my name.”</p>

<p>“And are these boys Jerry Hopkins, Ned Slade
and Bob Baker?”</p>

<p>“They are.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ve come to serve this paper on you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
them,” announced the man, opening a document
he carried.</p>

<p>“What sort of a paper is it?” asked the inventor.
“We have paid our entrance fee, if that’s what you
want.”</p>

<p>“This has nothing to do with an entrance fee.
This is an injunction, issued by a court of Indiana,
and is a document which prevents you, or any of
these boys, from removing from the State, using,
keeping possession of, or in any way having anything
to do with certain property, to wit: one airship
or dirigible balloon or aeroplane, known as
the <i>Comet</i>. Is this it?”</p>

<p>“This is it,” said Mr. Glassford slowly, “but I
don’t understand what you mean.”</p>

<p>“I mean that there’s an injunction out against
you or these boys using that airship, and I’m a
deputy sheriff sent to take possession of it.”</p>

<p>“An injunction!” cried Jerry. “Who took it
out?”</p>

<p>“Giles Hoswell.”</p>

<p>“Giles Hoswell!” exclaimed Mr. Glassford.
“Why, I know him!”</p>

<p>“Yes. He charges that this ship is built after
plans designed by him, which you stole,” went on
the deputy sheriff. “He has asked the courts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
protect him, and they will. You can’t use this airship.”</p>

<p>“But he has no right to get out an injunction,”
protested Mr. Glassford. “Those plans were
mine. Hoswell only worked for me, and I discharged
him because I found he was dishonest. He
has not the slightest claim on this airship.”</p>

<p>“That’s a matter for the courts to settle,” declared
the deputy. “All I know is that I was told
to serve this injunction on you, and I’ve done it.
Then I take possession here, and you can’t touch
that airship without getting in contempt of court,
which I wouldn’t advise you to do. You must not
touch this airship. I’m in possession, and you
must leave this tent!”</p>

<p>“Did any one else besides Hoswell appear in
getting out this injunction?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Hum, let me see,” replied the deputy, putting
on his glasses and looking at the legal document.
“Yes, there’s another name mentioned.”</p>

<p>“Whose is it?”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon. It seems he has an interest in
the ship for money advanced to Hoswell.”</p>

<p>“That explains it!” cried Jerry. “Noddy has
done this. He is backing up Hoswell. He wants
to prevent us going in the race.”</p>

<p>“Boys, it looks as if we were held up,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Glassford. “But don’t worry. I will at once consult
a lawyer, and we will see what can be done.”</p>

<p>“An injunction against the airship,” murmured
Professor Snodgrass, when the meaning of what
had just taken place was explained to him. “This
is very unpleasant. But never mind, I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the professor did not finish his sentence, for
he saw a new kind of fly on the shoulder of the
deputy sheriff, and he made a grab for it, much
to that official’s astonishment.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>SEARCHING FOR EVIDENCE</small></h2>


<p>As the boys, with Mr. Glassford and Professor
Snodgrass, were leaving the tent, two figures entered.
At the sight of one of them the inventor
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“So, Giles Hoswell, this is your work, is it?
This is how you repay my kindness to you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about your kindness,”
replied Hoswell stiffly, “but I know it was from my
plans that this airship was built, that you stole
them from me, and I intend to have my rights.”</p>

<p>“You are saying what is not so!” burst out Mr.
Glassford. “The only thing you ever planned was
a steering lever, and I purchased all your interest
in that, paying you well for it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll let the courts decide who is in the right,”
was Hoswell’s reply. “In the meantime the injunction
stands, and I warn you not to interfere with
my property.”</p>

<p>“Your property?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, my property. I consider this airship mine,
as it was built from my plans.”</p>

<p>“This is in keeping with your conduct while you
were with me,” spoke Mr. Glassford bitterly. “I
never could trust you, and I had to discharge you.
Now you are taking an unfair advantage which
the law gives you. But I will soon have my rights.
This injunction will be vacated, and I would sue
you for damages, only I know you have nothing.
You know that these plans were mine.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better prove it.”</p>

<p>“I intend to, and that very soon.”</p>

<p>“All right; and, in the meanwhile, the ship stays
here, Glassford,” said Hoswell with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I guess they won’t take part in any
race,” added the figure which had followed Hoswell;
and the motor boys, peering through the
semi-darkness of the tent, saw Noddy Nixon.</p>

<p>“You had a hand in this, Noddy,” remarked
Jerry. “It’s on a par with what you’re always
doing&mdash;something mean.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you talk that way to me!” cried Noddy
angrily. “I’ll complain to the court that you’re
making contempt.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we are, eh?” asked Ned with a laugh.
“Well, if there’s anything more contemptible than
you, I’d like to see it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get out of here!” cried Noddy, his anger rising
as he saw how the Cresville boys regarded him.
“You haven’t any right in this tent. Mr. Hoswell
and I own this now.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t! Nothing of the sort!” cried
Jerry.</p>

<p>“You had better go,” advised the deputy sheriff.
“There must be no quarreling before the representative
of the law, and I’m him.”</p>

<p>“If any damage is done to this airship I will
hold you, Hoswell and that Nixon chap responsible,”
said Mr. Glassford to the officer.</p>

<p>“No harm will come to it while I am in charge,”
replied the deputy. “Now you must go, and the
court will settle this dispute. The case will be
argued in two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Two weeks!” cried Ned. “Why, the races will
all be over then, and it will be too late&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Mr. Glassford quietly.
“Come on, boys. I will see a lawyer at once, and
find out what can be done. We are only losing
time disputing with these persons.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’re as good as you are,” retorted
Noddy, but no one answered him.</p>

<p>The unexpected taking away of their airship was
such a blow that the motor boys did not know what
to think about it. They had had some experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with the law, and they knew the delay that might
ensue, a delay which would prevent them taking
part in the contests in the air. But, though Mr.
Glassford was much annoyed by what had happened,
he had a calm and confident air, and the
boys felt better when they saw how he was taking
it.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass had hurried on ahead to
the hotel, as he had some specimens he wanted to
preserve, and it is doubtful if he gave a second
thought to the trouble his friends were in. This
was not because he was not kind and sympathetic,
but because his mind was engrossed with scientific
matters.</p>

<p>The clerk of the hotel told Mr. Glassford that
there was a lawyer in the building, and after a
short search the legal gentleman was located. He
readily agreed to take the case, and Mr. Glassford
informed him of what had taken place.</p>

<p>“The first thing to do,” said the lawyer, whose
name was Alfred Morton, “is to find some one
who can make an affidavit that the plans from
which the ship was constructed are your own, and
that this Hoswell had no part in them. Can you
produce such evidence?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” replied the inventor. “There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
a man named Masterly, who was working for me
at the time I drew these plans. He saw me draw
them, and even made some of the blue-prints for
me. That was before I ever knew Hoswell. Afterward
I hired him, and both he and Masterly
worked for me. Hoswell did make a suggestion
for a certain lever, which I adopted, and I paid
him well for it. That is all he ever had to do
with the ship. I discharged him when I found
him one day trying to steal some of my plans.
Masterly was there at the time, and he can testify
to that.”</p>

<p>“Then the thing to do,” said the lawyer, “is to
find this Masterly. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Well, now, that’s hard to say,” answered Mr.
Glassford. “The last I heard of him he was working
for a balloon-maker just outside of New York
City.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he would come here to testify?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it, if I could locate him, for he was
very friendly to me.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll send a telegram,” decided Mr.
Morton; and when he had obtained the address
of the balloon-maker he despatched a message
urging Masterly to come to Park Haven.</p>

<p>The motor boys and their friends did not pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
a very pleasant night, for, in spite of the measures
that had been taken, there was a possibility that
the injunction would not be vacated, or rendered of
no effect, until after the races, which were now
only a few days off.</p>

<p>Their fears were increased, when, the next forenoon,
a reply was received from the balloon manufacturer,
stating that Masterly no longer worked
for him, but had gone to a shop in Buffalo.</p>

<p>“Telegraph to Buffalo,” said the lawyer briskly.
“Your case all depends on Masterly, and he must
be found.”</p>

<p>But the message to Buffalo only brought an answer
that Masterly was no longer there. It was
suggested that the man might be in Chicago, and
a telegram was sent there, but with no result. The
last heard of Masterly, said the man who telegraphed
back from Chicago, was that he was out
in Denver.</p>

<p>“Say, I guess we’ll have to give up,” remarked
Bob in discouraged tones.</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Jerry. “We’ll wire to Denver.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk,” exclaimed the lawyer.
“We have several days yet, and we may locate him
in time.”</p>

<p>They had to wait a whole day for a reply from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Denver, and when it came it seemed as fruitless
as any of the others had been. The message stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Last heard of Masterly he was with an airship
inventor named Axtell. Don’t know where Axtell
is located.”</p></div>

<p>“Well, we do seem to be up against it,” remarked
Jerry dubiously as he read the message a
second time. “I wonder where in the world Axtell
can be?”</p>

<p>“Did you ever know an airship man by that
name?” the lawyer asked Mr. Glassford.</p>

<p>The inventor shook his head.</p>

<p>“There are so many in the business now,” he
said, “that it is impossible to keep track of them.
Axtell&mdash;Axtell&mdash;no, I never heard the name
before.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked the lawyer, “I don’t see what
can be done until you get hold of Masterly. Is
there no one else who could give the evidence we
need?”</p>

<p>“No one, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Say!” exclaimed Bob quickly, “I have an idea!”</p>

<p>“Can it; the weather’s not good for keeping
ideas,” said Ned, half sarcastically.</p>

<p>“No, I mean it,” went on the stout youth. “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
you want to find Axtell, why don’t you ask some
of the exhibitors out at the grounds? There are
a lot of airship men there, and maybe they know
of him, or can tell us of some one who does.”</p>

<p>“Bravo, Chunky!” cried Jerry. “That isn’t a
bad idea. I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“I would say that was a very good suggestion,”
remarked Mr. Morton. “Some one at the grounds,
where there are so many men interested in aeronautics,
ought to be able to give us a clue. But
wait; I have just thought of something. I will
telephone to the secretary of the carnival, and he
may be able to put us on the right track without
the need of so many inquiries as would otherwise
have to be made.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton lost no time in putting his idea into
execution. He telephoned from his office, where
the motor boys and their friends were, to the secretary
of the carnival, asking for any information
concerning Axtell or Masterly. Mr. Glassford
and the boys could hear the clicking of the receiver,
as the answer was returned.</p>

<p>“Good!” suddenly exclaimed the lawyer.
“That’s fine. We’ll be right out there!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Mr. Glassford eagerly.</p>

<p>“Axtell is on the grounds now,” explained the
lawyer. “He has a ship entered in the contests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and his assistant is Masterly. We have found our
man! Now to get him to make an affidavit, and
we will have that injunction formally vacated!”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Jerry. “That’s the best news
we’ve heard in a year.”</p>

<small>NODDY IS TRAPPED</small></h2>


<p>“Come on!” cried Ned, when the little party,
having left the lawyer’s office, stood in the street.
“This car goes out to the grounds.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do better than that,” said Jerry. “Let’s
hire an auto. I wish we’d brought ours. We
don’t want to lose any time. There are some
autos to hire just around the corner. One will
hold us all.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” said the lawyer, who accompanied
the boys and Mr. Glassford. Professor Snodgrass
was off somewhere hunting bugs and insects.</p>

<p>Seated in a speedy auto, which, however, the
boys declared was not as good as theirs, they were
soon hurrying to the carnival grounds.</p>

<p>Many more tents and buildings had been erected
in the last few days, as more entries were received,
and the place was now one of confusion, a big
throng moving about, watching the preparations
for the races, which were to take place in two days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go to the secretary’s office,” directed Mr. Morton.
“He can tell us where Axtell’s ship is located.”</p>

<p>The present employer of the much-wanted Masterly
had a tent at the far end of the exhibition
grounds, and thither the auto was directed. Mr.
Glassford was the first one to leap out, and he saw,
standing at the flap of the tent, a stout man with
very black hair.</p>

<p>“Mr. Axtell?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That’s my name.”</p>

<p>“I’m looking for an old employee of mine named
Masterly, who, I understand, works for you.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it? You can’t go hiring him
away from me at this late day. I need him to help
me to get my ship in shape. I’m going to win the
long distance prize.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want him to come and work for me,”
replied Mr. Glassford with a smile. “I merely
want him to make a certain affidavit. I’m in
trouble about my airship, and he is the only one
who can help me out.”</p>

<p>“That’s different,” declared Mr. Axtell, when
the matter had been explained to him. “Go in and
talk to Masterly. But he has a visitor already.”</p>

<p>“A visitor? Who?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. A young fellow. Came about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
half an hour ago. Said he wanted to see Masterly
on very important business.”</p>

<p>“May we go in?” asked Mr. Glassford, while
a vague feeling of uneasiness seemed to come to
Jerry and his chums. Who was the person now
in the tent with Masterly?</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes, go right in. I’m waiting here for a
man I expect. If Masterly can be of any service
to you, tell him I said he could take the rest of
the day off. My ship is in pretty good shape now.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mr. Glassford as he passed
inside, followed by the boys.</p>

<p>The most of the tent was occupied by a dirigible
balloon, of a type that was somewhat common.
The boys looked at it as they passed along, but they
were too anxious to see Masterly to pay much
attention to the airship.</p>

<p>As they advanced over the grass, which covered
the ground on which the tent was erected, their
footsteps making no sound, they heard talking in
the rear of the big canvas shelter.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you two hundred dollars to leave
town,” a voice was saying. “Two hundred dollars,
merely for keeping quiet.”</p>

<p>The voice startled Jerry and his chums. They
had heard it before many times. Jerry raised his
hand to indicate caution, and Mr. Glassford, Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and Bob came to a halt. They were concealed
from view by the big gas bag, but they could hear
plainly.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to do it,” they heard a voice
answering the one that had spoken first. “I’m
here, and I’m going to stay here. I haven’t seen
Mr. Glassford, but if he wants me to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed the other. “Not so loud.”</p>

<p>“That’s Masterly&mdash;the one who spoke before,”
said Mr. Glassford in a whisper.</p>

<p>“And the other is Noddy Nixon,” said Jerry.
“Let’s see what he’s up to.”</p>

<p>They listened.</p>

<p>“You can’t earn two hundred dollars any easier,”
went on Noddy. “All you have to do is to keep
still. I’m paying you for your silence. That’s
easy. When the case comes up just skip out of
town, and Mr. Hoswell will be able to prove that
the plans are his. That’s easy. Two hundred
dollars just for not saying that the plans are Glassford’s.”</p>

<p>“But the plans are Mr. Glassford’s!” exclaimed
Masterly. “I saw him draw them. I helped make
them. That Hoswell is a faker. He is no good.”</p>

<p>“That’s good evidence,” whispered the lawyer
to his clients. “We have caught him in the very
act of bribing a witness. That’s a serious offense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you won’t take my offer?” asked Noddy.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll not. Those plans are Mr. Glassford’s.
I haven’t seen him in some years, and I don’t know
where he is now, but if he wants my evidence he
can have it. I don’t play any mean tricks like that&mdash;not
for two hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make it three hundred!” said Noddy
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, not for three thousand! Now you clear
out of here. I want to do my work. If Mr. Glassford
was here I’d inform him of what you are
trying to do.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Glassford is here!” exclaimed the owner
of that name, suddenly stepping from behind the
gas bag. “Masterly, I’m glad to have heard you
say what you did. I do need your testimony to
defeat the plans of a scoundrel whom this young
man backed up with his money.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll be glad to help you!” cried Masterly
heartily, holding out his hand to his former employer.
“I thought there was something queer
about this fellow wanting to buy my silence.”</p>

<p>“He’ll find it more than queer,” spoke the lawyer
significantly. “I shall inform the court&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Noddy, with a quick motion, hurried from
the tent, crawling under the canvas at the rear.</p>

<p>“Catch him!” cried Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let him go,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>“He’ll make more trouble for us,” declared
Bob.</p>

<p>“We’ll be on the lookout,” went on Jerry. “If
he tries any more of his tricks I’ll have him arrested.”</p>

<p>“He could be taken into custody for what he has
already done,” said Mr. Morton, “but we must
not waste time on him. If Mr. Masterly will
come to my office I will draw up an affidavit, have
him sign it, and then we will present it to the
court. I have no doubt but that the injunction will
then immediately be vacated, and you can resume
control of your airship, Mr. Glassford.”</p>

<p>“And maybe we won’t be glad!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Can you go with us, Mr. Masterly?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, if Mr. Axtell says so.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” put in Mr. Axtell, entering
the tent. “Go ahead, Masterly. Airship captains
ought to help each other out, just as sea captains
do. I’m glad my man can be of service to you,
Mr. Glassford.”</p>

<p>“Now to get rid of that injunction,” said the
lawyer, as the party, accompanied by Mr. Masterly,
left the tent.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE STOLEN LEVER</small></h2>


<p>The court proceedings, once Masterly had made
his affidavit, in which he affirmed that the plans
of the <i>Comet</i> belonged solely to Mr. Glassford,
did not take long. The judge, after hearing Mr.
Morton present his case, inquired whether there
was anything to be said on the other side. But
the lawyer whom Hoswell had hired, with money
Noddy supplied, though notified to appear for his
client, did not do so. Probably Hoswell knew how
the case would go, and dropped it.</p>

<p>“I will vacate this injunction,” announced the officer
of the court.</p>

<p>“Does that mean we’ll have to vacate the tent
where the airship is?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No; it means that the order Hoswell got, forbidding
us to touch our own motor ship, is null,
void and of no effect or virtue,” replied Jerry in
a whisper. “Come on now, I want to see how the
<i>Comet</i> looks.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll soon have that pleasure,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
lawyer. “You can go and take charge now. I
will accompany you and serve this court order on
the deputy sheriff. He will then leave you in possession.
We may find Hoswell there. In case we
shall, do you want to make any charge against him,
Mr. Glassford?”</p>

<p>“I think not. Let him go. I want to give my
whole attention to the coming race. I can’t be
bothered by that scoundrel.”</p>

<p>But when they reached the tent they did not
find the conspirator there. The deputy sheriff was
asleep in the cabin of the <i>Comet</i>, where he had
taken his position, very likely, to prevent the ship
being removed without disturbing him.</p>

<p>The court order was shown him, and the deputy
at once announced that his duties were at an end.</p>

<p>“I’ve kept your ship safe for you,” he said. “It
wasn’t my fault that I had to take charge of it. Just
look it over. There’s not a thing happened to it.”</p>

<p>“Where is Hoswell?” asked Mr. Glassford.
“Has he been here lately?”</p>

<p>“He was here early this morning, but he left
in a hurry after that fellow&mdash;what’s his name?&mdash;Hixon
or Dixon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nixon,” supplied Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s it&mdash;Nixon. Well, Hoswell left in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
hurry when Nixon came here and told him something.”</p>

<p>“I guess Noddy told him how the game was
going,” said Jerry, “and Hoswell skipped out.
He probably knew we’d be along soon. But I
wonder how Noddy came to locate Masterly?”</p>

<p>“Hoswell put him up to that,” said Mr. Glassford.
“I asked Masterly about it, and he said
Noddy came to the tent, introduced himself, and
made his bribery proposition, which we so fortunately
overheard. Very likely Hoswell heard of
Masterly’s presence here and decided to try and
get ahead of me. But he got a dose of his own
medicine.”</p>

<p>“I only hope he didn’t damage the ship for revenge,”
remarked Ned. “It would be just like him,
or Noddy, to try to break some part of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Mr. Glassford, an anxious
look coming over his face. “We must make an
examination.”</p>

<p>With trained eyes and hands Mr. Glassford
rapidly went over the ship. It seemed to be all
right, and the boys were beginning to congratulate
themselves that they could make a trip yet that
day, when the inventor uttered an exclamation of
dismay.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“The steering lever&mdash;the one that operates the
elevation and depression planes&mdash;it’s gone&mdash;it’s
been taken off!”</p>

<p>“Taken off?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s quite complicated, and a very necessary
part of the ship. Some one has removed it.”</p>

<p>“Then it was Hoswell or Noddy,” declared
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Hoswell, more likely. Young Nixon wouldn’t
know how to take it off. It’s the lever Hoswell
gave me an idea for, and for which I paid him
well.”</p>

<p>“And now he’s taken it for revenge!” exclaimed
Ned. “What’s to be done? We must make a
new one at once.”</p>

<p>“Easier said than done,” replied Mr. Glassford.
“That lever is quite a complicated piece of work,
and it will take at least three days to construct a
new one and get it in place.”</p>

<p>“That will be too late for us to start in the
great race,” said Jerry solemnly. “Isn’t there any
other plan?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look so,” replied Mr. Glassford.
“The ship will not steer well without the use of
the elevation rudder, and I can’t work that without
the lever which Hoswell has stolen.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we could find him and make him give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
it up,” suggested Jerry. “If we could we might
be able to get the ship ready in time.”</p>

<p>“And if we don’t, we can’t,” was Mr. Glassford’s
rather dubious answer.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try the railroad stations?” suggested
the lawyer. “Most likely he’ll try to get
out of town as soon as possible. Could he carry
this lever with him?”</p>

<p>“He could, but it’s quite large, and I don’t believe
they’d let him take it into a passenger coach
with him.”</p>

<p>“Then he’d have to send it by express,” went on
the lawyer. “Make a tour of the express offices.
Very little express goes out before night, and perhaps
you can secure the lever. If you can locate
it I will arrange the necessary legal papers to enable
you to take possession of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” declared Mr. Glassford.
“Boys, we must make a tour of the express offices.
Start at once. We have very little time left. If
we don’t find that lever we can’t race.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll find it!” exclaimed Jerry confidently.</p>

<p>But that night, after a wearying round of the
different offices, the boys had to admit that they
were nearly beaten. There was no record of the
lever having been shipped, nor could they find any
trace of Hoswell. There were a number of express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
offices in Park Haven, but the answer was
the same at each one. Nothing like a lever had
been received for shipment.</p>

<p>“And the airship must be ready by to-morrow for
the race next day,” said Jerry. “I don’t see how
we’re going to do it. Can’t you rig up some sort
of an emergency lever, Mr. Glassford?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dare chance it. Never mind, we
will have to make a new one. We can’t have it in
time for the great race, but we can give an exhibition
and show the folks what the <i>Comet</i> can do.”</p>

<p>“That won’t be the race, though,” said Jerry
with a sigh. “I counted on winning one of the
two prizes.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” replied the inventor, “but we can’t
do it.”</p>

<p>They were much dispirited that night, and no
one slept well. To-morrow was the last day for
getting their ship ready, and they had to sign the
final papers the night before the race, giving the
official weights of the passengers, the power of
their motor, and other details. Without the lever
it would be useless to try and enter. Failure stared
them in the face.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we might as well go to the
grounds, and see the others making their final
preparations,” said Ned, the morning of the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
before the race. “We’re not in it, though, after
all our work. I suppose Noddy is laughing at us,
if he knows what a mean trick Hoswell played on
us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can depend upon it he knows about it,”
said Jerry. “If I catch him I’ll punch his face
good and proper.”</p>

<p>“That won’t find the lever,” spoke Ned with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“Say, why didn’t we try some of the freight offices?”
asked Bob suddenly. “Maybe Hoswell
shipped the lever by freight, so as to fool us.”</p>

<p>“Freight!” exclaimed Mr. Glassford.</p>

<p>“Freight!” cried Jerry. “That’s it! Maybe he
has. I wonder we didn’t think of that before.
Bob, you’re all to the ice-cream cone!”</p>

<p>“We’ll visit the freight offices at once,” said Mr.
Glassford. “There are only three of them, and it
won’t take long.”</p>

<p>“We three fellows will attend to the searching
part of it,” proposed Jerry. “You stay at the hotel,
Mr. Glassford, and whoever locates the lever will
telephone to you. Then you can have the lawyer
take whatever action is necessary to get it back.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good suggestion. Go ahead. I’ll
wait here for you.”</p>

<p>It was Bob’s luck to locate the lever at the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
depot of the railroad over which the <i>Comet</i> had
been shipped to Park Haven. The agent told Bob
that a man answering Hoswell’s description had
left the lever for shipment the night of the day on
which the injunction was vacated. It had been held
at the depot because there was so much other
freight to go out ahead of it.</p>

<p>Bob lost no time in telephoning the good news,
and that noon Mr. Glassford got possession of the
very necessary piece of machinery.</p>

<p>“Can we get the ship ready in time?” asked Jerry
anxiously as they were all in the tent where the
<i>Comet</i> swayed to and fro at her mooring ropes.</p>

<p>“We’re going to make a big attempt,” replied
Mr. Glassford, removing his coat, preparatory to
hard work.</p>

<small>“THEY’RE OFF!”</small></h2>


<p>Though Hoswell, in removing the lever, had
done no material damage to the ship, he had unscrewed
so many bolts and nuts, and had made so
many changes, that it was no small matter to get
everything in proper shape in the limited time
which remained.</p>

<p>But the boys and Mr. Glassford were earnest
workers, and they had much at stake. They toiled
with a will all the remainder of the day, and toward
evening they saw success ahead of them.</p>

<p>“There, it’s on!” announced the inventor as he
stepped back to gaze at the work. “Now, boys,
if you’ll get busy and tighten up the stay and guy
wires I’ll arrange the gas-generating machine.
We’ll barely have time enough, as it is, to fill the
bag.”</p>

<p>“And we can’t make any trial flight,” said Jerry.
“All the other machines had try-outs to-day.”</p>

<p>“It’s out of the question for us,” responded Mr.
Glassford. “But I have no fear of what the <i>Comet</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
will do. She has proved herself able to do wonders
in the air, and though we may not win the race, we
will make a good attempt. Now, boys, get busy.”</p>

<p>It was late that afternoon when the inventor
pronounced everything in good shape, save the
generating of the gas, and this was proceeding as
rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>“I think we can take a little rest now,” said Mr.
Glassford. “By the way, where is the professor?
He is going along to-morrow, is he not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’d miss it for anything,” declared
Jerry. “He said he was going, when I saw
him early this morning.”</p>

<p>“And where was that?”</p>

<p>“He was starting for a pond he had heard of,
where he said he intended to catch a new species
of pollywog&mdash;a kind with little horns on its head.
But that was before we had located the lever. I
don’t know whether he is aware that we will start
in the race as soon as possible to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“We must tell him to-night, then. If you boys
like you may go back to the hotel. Everything
has been done here that can be done, and I will
watch the gas machine. You might look up the
professor.”</p>

<p>As the boys were going toward their hotel, Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
who was a little in advance, uttered an exclamation
as he turned a corner.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry. “Slip on
a banana peel?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’m almost sure I saw Noddy Nixon
dodge into that fruit store over there. It looked
just like him.”</p>

<p>“I thought he had left the city,” observed Jerry.
“I wish he would before the race.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Because, Chunky, it makes me nervous to think
of what trouble he might make.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe he’ll come within a mile of
us,” declared Ned. “He’s too frightened. If
that was him just then, he dodged like a scared rabbit.”</p>

<p>“All the same, I’d feel easier if he was a few
hundred miles away,” went on Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why, what can he do?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“There’s no telling. But I think I can arrange
matters so as to get ahead of him. I’m glad Ned
saw him. It puts us on our guard.”</p>

<p>That evening Jerry was seen in conversation
with the hotel detective at the inn where they
stopped, and though Jerry said nothing to his
chums of what he and the officer talked about, Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and Ned heard the latter say, as their friend left
him:</p>

<p>“I’ll get you a good man, all right, and I’ll have
him on the grounds. If there’s any funny work
he’ll stop it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>The boys found Professor Snodgrass, prowling
about the big corridor of the hotel, with an intent
look on his face.</p>

<p>“Are you looking for any one, professor?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“I am looking for a very rare species of moth
that I saw flying about here a while ago,” replied
the scientist. “I had one specimen, but it was so
small that it escaped through the meshes of my
net. I went back to my room, made a net of a
handkerchief, and now I expect to capture the
moth. Only it seems to have flown away.”</p>

<p>“Did you get any horned pollywogs?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not a one. I fished around in the pond all
day, but I caught a new kind of dragon fly, so I
am just as well pleased.”</p>

<p>The professor was told to be on hand in the
morning, and then, as they knew they had to be
up early, the boys went to bed. Mr. Glassford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
came in about midnight, having left a man on
guard in the airship tent.</p>

<p>After a hasty breakfast the little party, who soon
expected to be sailing through the air, went to
where the <i>Comet</i> was kept. They found the gas
bag fully distended, and the big ship was tugging
and swaying away, almost lifting the extra heavy
ballast that had been attached to counterbalance
the added lifting power of the gas.</p>

<p>“How about food?” asked Bob rather anxiously
as he walked about the motor ship. “We’re likely
to be in the air for some time, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“If everything goes well we shall be,” replied
Mr. Glassford. “But the pantry is well stocked,
Bob; don’t worry.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, if that’s the case,” was Chunky’s answer.</p>

<p>“How long a trip do you expect to make?”
asked the professor, while his eyes roved about in
search of any possible stray insect worth catching.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope to be up in the air at least two
nights,” said Mr. Glassford. “Of course, one can
never tell exactly what is going to happen. You
know there are two prizes of twenty-five hundred
dollars each. One will be given the owners of the
motor ship which remains up the greatest number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of hours, and the other to the machine which
travels the longest distance.”</p>

<p>“Then there is a possibility of us getting both
prizes, is there not?”</p>

<p>“A possibility, yes, but no probability, though I
hope we will get one prize.”</p>

<p>To be sure that nothing was lacking to make
the trip a success, Mr. Glassford, aided by the
boys, went over every inch of the motor ship, and
tested the motor. It seemed to work well.</p>

<p>An extra supply of gasolene and water had been
put on board, together with plentiful stores and
supplies, the recording and measuring instruments,
and everything that ingenuity or science could suggest
to make the trip a success.</p>

<p>There were five other motor ships entered in the
race. They were all forms of the dirigible balloon,
of various shapes and sizes, but none had the aeroplane
arrangement that the <i>Comet</i> possessed.
Three of the airships were larger than the craft
of the motor boys, and the remaining two were
somewhat smaller. All were powerful machines,
and in tests all had shown that they could go up
to a great height and move with considerable speed
in the air. Owing to Hoswell’s action, the <i>Comet</i>
had been tried only once at Park Haven, and aside
from her owners, few felt that she would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
much of a showing. The “favorite,” if one may
use such a term, was a large red balloon, and when
Mr. Glassford saw it coming from the big tent,
not far from where the <i>Comet</i> was sheltered, he
shook his head rather dubiously.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine machine,” he said. “Her propellers
look to be more powerful than ours, but I
think we can do better if it comes on to blow, which
it is very likely to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll win,” said Bob confidently.</p>

<p>Word was given for all six of the big balloons,
that were to take part in the race which was to
formally open the carnival, to prepare to start.
Some had already left the sheltering sheds or tents,
and now the <i>Comet’s</i> nose was poked out.</p>

<p>She was buoyant, even with all the weight of ballast
and the restraining hands of scores of men who
volunteered to help lift the motor ship out and
into position. The big gas bag tugged and swayed
in the network of cords as if anxious to be free.</p>

<p>There was some little delay at the start, and
Mr. Glassford took advantage of it to give the
motor another test. The crowd leaped back in
alarm as a series of sudden explosions sounded
from the machine, and the big propellers revolved
slowly, for the full speed gear was not thrown
into place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess it’ll do,” said Mr. Glassford at length.
“Now, I wish they’d start.”</p>

<p>But it appeared that one of the ships had developed
a small defect at the last moment, and it
was announced that the start would be delayed an
hour. Mr. Glassford and the boys entered the
cabin of their motor ship and sat down.</p>

<p>All at once there was excited shouting off to their
left. The crowd began to run in that direction.</p>

<p>“Something’s happened!” exclaimed Bob, hurrying
from the cabin.</p>

<p>“It does sound so,” admitted Jerry.</p>

<p>The shouting came nearer. Then the crowd approached
closer to the anchored <i>Comet</i>. A moment
later something big and shining, with monstrous,
flapping wings, and which emitted a sound like a
battery of Gatling guns in action, seemed to rush
past the motor ship.</p>

<p>“It’s a new animal! It’s a wonderful new animal!”
cried Professor Snodgrass, grasping his
butterfly net. “I must have it for my collection.”</p>

<p>The object, whatever it was, made a sudden
change in its course, and came back toward the
<i>Comet</i>. Bright metal wings could be seen flashing
in the sun, and what looked like long steel legs or
arms opened and shut, like the limbs of a kangaroo
in full flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s Abernot’s flying grasshopper!” cried Jerry.
“He’s trying it! Look, here he comes!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, that curious form of airship was
approaching at full speed.</p>

<p>“He may run into us!” cried Mr. Glassford.</p>

<p>It did seem as if there was some danger, but
just as the clumsy machine was within twenty-five
feet of the <i>Comet</i> the motor, with a sob and moan,
ceased working, and the flying grasshopper came
to a stop. Then it could be seen that a man was
seated just where the big wings were fastened to
the body.</p>

<p>“Does it work, Mr. Abernot?” asked Jerry,
calling to his friend.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the inventor dubiously, “the
centrifugal plates are all that I could wish. The
powerful springs in the legs seem to operate, but
I can’t understand why I didn’t rise in the air. The
wings are certainly large enough, and they vibrated
very rapidly. I can’t understand it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps your apparatus is too heavy,” suggested
Mr. Glassford.</p>

<p>“Maybe it is,” agreed the inventor of the flying
grasshopper machine, which, however, was more
like a jumping frog. “I believe that’s the trouble.
I shall make my next one lighter.”</p>

<p>He started the motor again, twisted the steering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
wheel, and the legs began to kick out. The machine
carried its inventor over the ground in a
series of surprising leaps, but, though the wings
flapped harder than before, there was no “flying”
to it.</p>

<p>“Another freak,” murmured Jerry.</p>

<p>A man, sent from the committee in charge of
the start, hurried up to announce that the repairs
had been completed on the balloon which was the
cause of the delay.</p>

<p>“Shall we go now?” asked Mr. Glassford.</p>

<p>“When you hear the pistol shot. It will be
fired in five minutes.”</p>

<p>Those five minutes seemed the longest that ever
a watch ticked off, but they finally passed. Mr.
Glassford had stationed a man at the rope, a pull
on which would release all the ballast bags at
once.</p>

<p><em>Crack!</em></p>

<p>Through the curiously still air sounded the revolver
shot. The crowd, every person in which
seemed to be holding his breath, gave vent to a
shout. Six great bodies leaped from the earth.</p>

<p>“They’re off!” yelled the throng, and then there
came a perfect roar of cheers and applause that
sounded like hail pattering on a tin roof.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>NODDY GETS HIS DESERTS</small></h2>


<p>Swift as the <i>Comet</i> shot from the earth, with
that same curious sensation to those aboard of her
that it was the ground dropping away, her speed
was not so fast but that something which happened
almost directly beneath it was seen by the motor
boys. This was the sight of Noddy Nixon stepping
forth from behind the corner of the tent and
aiming a gun at the motor ship.</p>

<p>“He’s shooting at us!” cried Bob, leaning out
from the cabin window and gazing down.</p>

<p>A second later the spiteful “zip” of a leaden
missile could be heard, as it shot past the car, narrowly
missing the gas bag.</p>

<p>“He almost hit us!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“That will be his last shot,” said Jerry quietly.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” called back Mr. Glassford
from the steering tower. Though it was some
distance away, it was so quiet in the upper air that
even a whisper could be heard the whole length
of the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because I arranged to have him taken care of,”
replied Jerry. “There! he’s under arrest now.”</p>

<p>As the travelers leaned over the edge of the car
they saw a man rush out from the crowd and grab
Noddy before he had time to fire again. The
man caught the gun from the bully’s hand and
threw it far away. Then, with a firm hold on
Noddy’s collar, which he maintained in spite of the
efforts of that youth to break away, the sneak who
hoped to damage the airship was led away.</p>

<p>“That settles his hash,” remarked Jerry. “He’ll
go to jail for a few weeks, at least.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, when you saw him in the city yesterday
I had a notion that he’d be up to something like
this. I decided to take some precautions, so I
spoke to the hotel detective. He arranged to have
a private officer out on the grounds near our tent.
He had a description of Noddy, and was instructed
to arrest him if he saw him shooting at our gas
bag. I didn’t think Noddy would dare do it, but
you see he did. Fortunately, the detective grabbed
him before he could fire a second shot, or he might
have damaged our ship considerably.”</p>

<p>“It was a dastardly trick,” commented Mr.
Glassford, “and I am glad you got ahead of him,
Jerry. I hope Noddy will get his deserts now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Of course, our gas bag is in sections, and even if
one was punctured we would still be able to manage,
but I want all the power possible this trip,
as I think we are going to have a close contest.”</p>

<p>“Which machine do you fear the most?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“That big red one. Its bag contains more gas
than ours does, but I believe we have the more
powerful airship. Well, I think we are now high
enough to start the motor.”</p>

<p>None of the ships had their propellers going as
yet, since those in charge of them wished to attain
a certain height and get in a favorable air current
before moving forward.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, did Mr. Glassford start his
motor than explosions began to sound from the
other five craft. The big propellers of the <i>Comet</i>
began to revolve, and the ship, feeling the influence
of them, darted forward.</p>

<p>The conditions of the race were that the ships
were to head, as nearly as possible, toward New
Orleans. This was almost directly south of the
place from where they had started. Of course, it
was not expected that they would all reach the city
of molasses fame, but that point was set at the
farthest limit to which it was thought any machine
would get.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>In the steering tower Mr. Glassford listened
with a critical ear to the song of the motor and
other machinery of his craft.</p>

<p>“She’s working like a daisy,” he said enthusiastically.
“If nothing happens, boys, we’ll win
one prize, anyhow.”</p>

<p>It was a wonderful sight to see the great airships&mdash;six
of them&mdash;high in the air, all headed in
one direction. They looked like great birds, especially
the <i>Comet</i>, with its broad white aeroplanes.
Her pointed nose was headed almost south, as indicated
by the compass, and Mr. Glassford, as
engineer, gradually increased the speed of the
motor.</p>

<p>At first the six ships were about on a line, moving
forward together, and at about the same height.
Then the big red one shot ahead, taking a place
in the lead.</p>

<p>“Don’t let her beat us,” begged Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” advised Mr. Glassford. “The
race has only started. I can catch up if I want to.
But I’m going a little higher. I think I can get
into a swifter current of air.”</p>

<p>He shifted the elevation rudder and the <i>Comet</i>
darted toward the sky. One of the other ships
started to follow, and then, whether the pilot
changed his mind or whether he could not manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
his craft, it had to drop back on a level with the
other four.</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford’s plan to go higher was soon
demonstrated to be a good one. Without increasing
the speed of the motor he slowly began to
overhaul the red ship, as the <i>Comet</i> was in a
swifter air current.</p>

<p>In the upper regions there are as many currents
as there are in the ocean, and while at a certain
level one may be moving slowly, a few hundred
feet higher or lower there may be another moving
twice as fast. The balloonist who can take advantage
of these currents is much benefited, especially
in a race.</p>

<p>But, though he nearly caught up to the big red
airship, Mr. Glassford did not send his machine
ahead, which he might easily have done had he
increased the speed of the motor. But he wanted
to be sparing of his gasolene; and, as he said, the
race was only just started.</p>

<p>The other four ships were slightly in the rear,
and they were all about in line.</p>

<p>After the first excitement of the start was over,
the boys settled down to enjoy themselves. They
were about a thousand feet high, and in spite of
the sun there was a cool breeze. Below them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
earth stretched out like a broad map. Park Haven
was fast disappearing in the distance.</p>

<p>All the forenoon they sailed, keeping in about
the same relative positions. Dinner was eaten at
an elevation of a little over half a mile, as Mr.
Glassford went up still higher in an endeavor to
locate a better air current, in which he was not
successful.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the red balloon increased
her lead somewhat, and the boys looked a trifle
anxiously at their pilot. Mr. Glassford, however,
evinced no alarm.</p>

<p>“I guess you’d better take charge a while, Jerry,”
he said. “I want to adjust some of the recording
instruments.”</p>

<p>Jerry, trying to appear like a veteran, went to
the steering tower, while his chums amused themselves
by taking snapshots of the earth below them,
with cameras they had brought along.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed, with the red ship still
ahead, but Mr. Glassford would not increase the
speed of his motor. It began to grow dusk,
though it was not time for the sunset. A look to
the west showed a big bank of clouds that had
obscured the sun.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’re in for a storm,” remarked the
inventor as he went toward the pilot house.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>IN A HEAVY STORM</small></h2>


<p>“Do you apprehend any danger to the ship in
case of a storm?” asked Professor Snodgrass, calling
the question to Mr. Glassford, who was now
in the pilot house.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” was the answer. “I expect we will
meet with a storm or two before we finish. There
are frequently storms in the upper air that do not
get down to the earth. But the <i>Comet</i> is well
built, and I am not afraid. I hope you are not,
professor.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, but I was thinking that if
there was a storm it might scatter the insects which
I hope to capture to illustrate my book on bugs
of the upper air.”</p>

<p>“There are some kind of bugs over on this side,
near my window, professor,” called Bob.</p>

<p>“Some more mosquitoes, probably,” remarked
Jerry as he came back from the steering tower,
where Mr. Glassford had relieved him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, they’ve got funny little fuzzy things on
their legs. They’re not mosquitoes.”</p>

<p>“Fuzzy things on their legs!” exclaimed the
professor. “That is a very rare form of a katydid,
which lives only in the upper air. I must
catch some.”</p>

<p>He hurried to where Bob was, carrying his long-handled
net, and he soon caught more of the odd insects
than he cared for. Some he preserved in
small boxes, and the others he released.</p>

<p>It grew darker and darker as the clouds gathered,
until it was difficult to see more than a few
hundred feet away from the motor ship. Still
Mr. Glassford pressed on, keeping his course due
south.</p>

<p>“I can’t see any of the other airships,” remarked
Ned, trying to peer through the gloom.</p>

<p>“Try the telescope,” suggested the inventor, and
the lad took a large one from the rack in the cabin.
But even with the aid of the powerful glass there
was nothing to be seen.</p>

<p>“Better close the cabin windows, light the lamps,
and get ready for a bad night,” said Mr. Glassford
presently.</p>

<p>The boys did so, and soon, with lamps glowing
in the cozy little cabin, even though they knew a
bad storm was gathering, every one felt safer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess it must be supper-time,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“Chunky tells by his stomach, not by the clock,”
commented Jerry. “All right, Bob, set out the
repast, if you like.”</p>

<p>The lad lost no time in complying, having constituted
himself cook of the motor ship, and a
simple but good meal was soon prepared on the
gasolene stove.</p>

<p>“Ned, suppose you take charge in the pilot house
while I eat,” called Mr. Glassford down the little
flight of stairs which led from the main cabin to
the steering tower. “All you have to do is keep
everything where I leave it, and maintain a course
as near south as you can. We’re making to the
west some, as the wind is a little too strong for
us, but by changing the angle of the planes we
may overcome it a bit.”</p>

<p>Ned, with some anxiety, went to the pilot house,
but he had little to do, as most of the machinery
was automatic, and he only had to watch the gages
and occasionally move a lever or a wheel.</p>

<p>“We’re still making a little too much west,”
said Mr. Glassford anxiously when he again took
charge. “I think I’ll change our elevation a trifle.”</p>

<p>“Going up or down?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Down, I think. I don’t care to be too high up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
when the storm breaks, as it looks as if it would
very soon now.”</p>

<p>Low mutterings of thunder and occasional flashings
of lightning bore out this belief. There was
no howling of the wind, as there is on earth in a
storm, for the reason that the motor ship was being
carried right along with the gale, being a part of
it, so to speak, and it offered no resistance to the
air current. Occasionally, when a cross current
blew through the guy wires and gas bag net, there
was a low moaning sound, not very cheerful to
hear.</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford shifted the elevation rudder, and
the ship at once poked her pointed nose toward the
earth. It was now very dark, and nothing could be
seen outside of the craft. Still, there was no fear
of colliding with anything in the upper air, and
the pilot might as well have closed his eyes, for all
he could see ahead of him.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll smash into the red balloon,” suggested
Bob. “It must be below and ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“It’s very hard to say where it is,” remarked
Jerry, “but I don’t believe there’s any danger of
a collision. We’re only a thousand feet high now,”
he added, looking at one of the registers in the
cabin.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’re right over some city,” added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Ned, opening a cabin window and thrusting his
head out to take an observation. “I can see thousands
of lights underneath us.”</p>

<p>The other boys also looked, and saw below them
what seemed to be millions of tiny fireflies, as they
sparkle over a meadow on a June night. They
were the lights of a large city, and doubtless the
inhabitants of it, if they looked up and saw an illuminated
body shooting across the heavens (for
the lights of the motor ship could plainly be seen
from below), imagined that it was a new style of
comet, as, indeed, it was.</p>

<p>Then as Mr. Glassford again shifted the lever
of the elevation rudder, the motor ship resumed
an even keel and shot along about nine hundred
feet above the earth. It was calmer at this elevation,
and though the signs of the storm did not
abate the travelers hoped they might escape the
worst of it.</p>

<p>But the hope was a vain one. Half an hour
later, when the boys were beginning to think of
seeking their bunks, for they were very tired from
the day of preparation, the ship suddenly lurched
to one side. It was such a violent motion that
Bob, who was walking across the cabin, was thrown
into Jerry’s lap, as he sat reading a paper.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Professor Snodgrass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
looking up from some notes he was making
concerning the latest insects he had captured.
“Have we landed?”</p>

<p>“We’re in a bad storm,” called Mr. Glassford
from the steering tower. “Jerry, you’ll have to
come here and help me. I can’t manage everything
at once.”</p>

<p>Once more the ship tilted at an unpleasant angle,
but Jerry managed to make his way to the pilot
house.</p>

<p>“Change the planes!” cried Mr. Glassford, and
he had to shout to make his voice heard above the
noise of a counter current of wind that was now
howling through the rigging of wires and wooden
braces. “Shift them about four feet. That may
put us on a level keel again,” for the motor ship
was now almost in the position of a sailing ship
when she has nearly been thrown “on her beam-ends”
by a heavy blow and the action of the waves.</p>

<p>Jerry shifted the handles manipulating the
planes, while Mr. Glassford steered the ship to one
side to take some of the wind pressure off the big
areas of taut muslin. An instant later the <i>Comet</i>
swung around and floated level. The worth of
the aeroplanes had been quickly demonstrated.
Without them the ship could not have been so
easily managed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>On and on rushed the motor ship, the powerful
propellers fairly pulling her through the air. They
had left the lighted city far behind, and were now
over what was probably open country, for there
was no illumination.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a fierceness that was appalling,
the storm broke upon them. There came a dash
of rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning,
and the fury of the blast fairly bore the craft down.</p>

<p>“We’re falling!” cried Ned as he looked at the
hand of the elevation gage and noted that they
were steadily approaching the earth.</p>

<p>“Keep cool!” called Jerry from the pilot house.</p>

<p>At the same instant the ship shot upward, for
Mr. Glassford, realizing the danger, had shifted
the lever to tilt the rudder, and the <i>Comet</i> began
to ascend. But as they went higher the storm
became worse, until they were right in the midst of
it.</p>

<p>All at once the wind shifted, and instead of
blowing from the northeast, so as to send the ship
in a southeasterly direction, it blew from the east,
full, driving the travelers to the west.</p>

<p>“That isn’t the way we want to go,” remarked
Bob. “New Orleans doesn’t lie in that direction.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can’t help ourselves,” spoke Ned.
“It’s a bad storm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Glassford tried to shift the planes, so as to
counteract the changing wind, but he had little
success.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go higher,” he said to Jerry, who
stood beside him in the pilot house. “We may
be able to get above the storm.”</p>

<p>He pulled the lever toward him. The ship
again tilted her nose toward the heavens. The
speed of the motor was increased, and the <i>Comet</i>
fairly trembled throughout her whole frame.
Anxiously did the travelers watch the compass to
see if their course would be changed. Up and up
shot the airship. Then, with a loud explosion, the
motor stopped, and those in the <i>Comet</i> felt her
falling rapidly.</p>

<p>“Something’s broken!” cried Jerry as he hurried
from the steering tower to the engine compartment.</p>

<small>AFTER A STRANGE BIRD</small></h2>


<p>The <i>Comet</i> was now at the mercy of the wind,
as, the propellers no longer revolving, the motor
ship had no steerage way. The craft was whirled
and tossed about, and those in it, especially the
boys, were much frightened.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed!” cried Mr. Glassford.
“We can’t possibly fall, and I’ll soon have her
before the wind again.”</p>

<p>He quickly changed the elevation rudder, and
so adjusted it as to send the ship downward on a
long, slanting course. This gave the desired momentum,
and the craft rode on a more even keel&mdash;if
an airship has a keel.</p>

<p>“Ned, you come here and take charge of things,”
called Mr. Glassford, “while Jerry and I look at
the motor.”</p>

<p>Ned found little to do, save to keep steady the
rudder which controlled the side motion of the
ship. Meanwhile, Jerry was looking over the
motor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t find anything wrong with it,” he said
as Mr. Glassford came up. “It seems to be all
right.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t exactly like the engine in an automobile,”
said the inventor, “though it’s nearer
that in construction than anything else. Let me
have a look.”</p>

<p>Carefully he went over every part of it. Then
he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“I’ve found the trouble!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“One of the spark-plugs has broken, and it backfired.
That was the explosion we heard. I’ll
soon have it fixed.”</p>

<p>It did not take long to adjust the machinery.
Meanwhile, the <i>Comet</i> was shooting downward at
a rapid rate. In some alarm Jerry noted that they
were now only a few hundred feet above the surface
of the earth. Unless the depression rudder
was soon shifted they would strike the ground
and lose all possible chance at the prizes, to say
nothing of perhaps damaging the ship.</p>

<p>“There!” cried Mr. Glassford at length. “Now
I can start the motor. Jerry, tell Ned to change
the elevation rudder. We will go up now.”</p>

<p>An instant later the hum, throb and crackle of
the machinery told that the propellers were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
motion, and with a swoop like some great bird the
<i>Comet</i> once more sailed upward toward the sky.</p>

<p>The storm had moderated somewhat, though it
was still raining hard. This, however, did not
bother the travelers, as their craft was snug and
tight.</p>

<p>“We’re doing a little better,” announced Mr.
Glassford as he glanced at the compass. “Not
making so much west as we were, but still too
much to enable us to reach New Orleans on this
course. Now, I think you boys can turn in. I’ll
manage the ship. In fact, there is little to do.”</p>

<p>“Call us at daylight,” said Jerry. “We want to
see how much country we’ve covered, and where we
are.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised the inventor.</p>

<p>Strange as it was to go to bed aboard an airship,
the boys managed to fall asleep quickly.
The only sound was that made by the machinery,
and the occasional moan of the wind. Professor
Snodgrass remained up quite late, classifying his
specimens, and then he too sought his berth.</p>

<p>It was just getting light when Jerry awakened
without having had to be called by Mr. Glassford.
He got up, and his movements about the bunkroom
aroused his chums.</p>

<p>“Where are we?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea,” replied Jerry. “We’re
still moving, however.”</p>

<p>“Is the storm over?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Seems to be,” was Jerry’s answer as he peered
from a window. “Yes, the sun’s coming up. Take
a look&mdash;it’s great.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the rising sun, seen from an airship,
with nothing to obstruct the view, is a magnificent
sight, and one the boys had never witnessed
before.</p>

<p>“Is everything all right?” asked Jerry as he
went to the steering tower, where Mr. Glassford
was still on duty.</p>

<p>“Yes; the night passed off very well. The ship
is running very satisfactorily, and I think I’ll let
you take charge now, and get some sleep myself.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you need it,” remarked Jerry. “Bob
is getting breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Trust him for that,” said Mr. Glassford with
a smile.</p>

<p>A look all around the horizon failed to show
the presence of any other of the contesting airships,
though of course the travelers did not
know whether they were ahead of or behind their
rivals. They hoped the former.</p>

<p>With Jerry in the pilot house the motor ship
was sent along at rapid speed, while Ned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Bob sat with Professor Snodgrass in the main
cabin. The little scientist was keeping a lookout
for any insects or birds that he might add to his
collection. So far his trip had not been very profitable
to him.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” suddenly asked Ned, pointing
to a small black speck off to the right.</p>

<p>“Maybe one of the airships,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“No, it’s too small.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it’s a good way off.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t an airship,” went on Ned. “But
whatever it is, it’s coming nearer.”</p>

<p>“Get the telescope,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>Ned did so, and when he had focussed it on
the speck he uttered an exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p>“It’s a bird&mdash;a strange bird!” he said.</p>

<p>“A bird!” repeated the professor. “It must
be a rare sort of bird to be this high in the air.
Let me take a look.”</p>

<p>He made an observation, and at once became
very much excited.</p>

<p>“I must capture that for my collection!” he
cried. “I have long wished to possess a specimen
of that kind, and now I have a chance to get it.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have hard work,” commented
Ned. “It seems to be going away from us now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will ask Mr. Glassford to take after it,”
said the scientist, hurrying toward the sleeping-cabin,
where Mr. Glassford was.</p>

<p>The inventor, once he understood the request
of the scientist, and learned that the bird was not
too far off, agreed to change the course of the
ship.</p>

<p>“We ought to work back to the right, anyhow,”
he said. “We must be many miles off our course.”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the airship approached the
bird. The winged creature, instead of being
frightened, flew closer to the <i>Comet</i> as if to inspect
it. Nearer and nearer the creature came. The
professor was all excitement. With his longest-handled
net he stood at an open window, ready
to capture the rare specimen.</p>

<p>“A little more to the right, Jerry,” called Ned.</p>

<p>Jerry shifted the steering lever. The <i>Comet</i>
swooped toward the bird. The professor leaned
out of the window with his net and made a sweep
to entangle the bird in the meshes. But a sudden
shift of the wind slightly altered the ship’s level,
and the next instant the scientist’s body shot out
of the window. The airship was more than a mile
above the earth.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE RED BALLOON</small></h2>


<p>“Catch him! Save him!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Ned did not cry out, but he made a convulsive
spring for the professor, just as he was disappearing.</p>

<p>Now, Nature had blessed the scientist with a
pair of long legs, though she had made his body
very short. Consequently, though his body was
entirely out of the window, and his head was
hanging down toward the earth, his feet had not
yet passed over the sill. This Ned saw, and he took
advantage of it like a flash.</p>

<p>He grabbed the professor’s ankles with all his
strength and threw himself backward to counteract
the effect of the pull caused by the involuntary
tumble of the little man.</p>

<p>“Grab me, Bob!” cried Ned, and his chum had
presence of mind enough to do as he was told
without stopping to ask why.</p>

<p>The result was that the professor was caught
just in time, and the grips of the two sturdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
youths prevented him from falling. But they
could not pull him in, as his loose trousers had
caught on the sill. All they could do was to hold
him there while Jerry, all unconscious of what
had happened, was in the steering tower, sending
the ship ahead at great speed.</p>

<p>“Help!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>The professor had uttered no sound. Probably
he was too frightened. Mr. Glassford heard
the cry, and rushed from the sleeping-cabin, half
dressed. He saw what had happened, and adding
his strength to that of the boys, the poor professor
was soon pulled inside the cabin. His face was
red, for much blood had run to his head, but otherwise
he was calm and collected.</p>

<p>“Look out for the handle of my net,” he said
as he stood in the cabin and began to haul in his
apparatus for catching specimens.</p>

<p>“What, didn’t you drop your net?” asked Ned
in great astonishment.</p>

<p>“And lose that valuable bird?” inquired the
professor. “I guess not. I caught it, all right,
and have it safe in the net. Here it is.”</p>

<p>He continued to pull the net in, and a moment
later showed to his audience a curious bird, with
brilliant plumage. The little creature was entangled
in the meshes of the net, but the scientist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
carefully disentangled it, and placed the bird in a
small cage.</p>

<p>“That will be a most valuable addition to my
collection,” he said. “It is worth all this trip
has cost me.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir, you might have met a horrible
death!” exclaimed Mr. Glassford.</p>

<p>“I didn’t, though,” retorted the professor with
a calm smile. “‘A miss is as good as a mile,’ you
know.”</p>

<p>“Don’t take any more misses like that,” urged
the inventor.</p>

<p>“I probably won’t see any more birds like this
one,” was what the scientist replied.</p>

<p>Breakfast was served at a mile and a quarter
above the earth, Mr. Glassford having decided
to go higher in search of a different current that
would carry the <i>Comet</i> in a more southerly direction.
The upper regions, however, did not seem
to furnish what he wanted, and after sailing along
for several miles he decided to drop back toward
the earth again. Accordingly, the depression rudder
was set, and the pointed nose of the motor
ship was aimed at <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i>.</p>

<p>They ran into a bank of white, fleecy clouds,
and for a time nothing could be seen but them,
for the travelers were enveloped as in a dense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
fog. Then they dropped through that, and saw
spread out below them a big open stretch of country.</p>

<p>But something else was also below them. The
three boys, who were in the cabin, all saw it at
once, and their cry attracted the attention of Mr.
Glassford.</p>

<p>“The red balloon!” cried Jerry. “It’s the red
balloon from Park Haven! It’s ahead of us!
Let’s race it, Mr. Glassford.”</p>

<p>The inventor was not at all unwilling to try
conclusions with his rival, especially since a whole
day had passed and the red airship was still ahead.
It was time for the <i>Comet</i> to show what she could
do.</p>

<p>The ship was sent down until it was about on a
level with the red balloon. Then Mr. Glassford
speeded up the motor to overtake his rival, that
was over a mile ahead.</p>

<p>The boys took turns watching it through the
telescope, and they could note that the four men
on the red craft were also observing them through
glasses.</p>

<p>“Do you think we can beat them?” asked Bob
anxiously.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to,” replied Jerry. “Leave it to Mr.
Glassford.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The inventor soon sent for Jerry to aid him
in the steering tower, and the two were kept busy
manipulating the wheels and levers.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go up a trifle,” announced Mr.
Glassford, when at the end of half an hour of
speeding they had gained little if anything on the
red machine. “There is a slight contrary wind at
this level.”</p>

<p>Once more the motor craft ascended. The wisdom
of this was at once apparent. Aided by a
stiff breeze, blowing in the same direction as that
in which the <i>Comet</i> was sailing, she rapidly began
to overhaul the red balloon. But the pilot of that
was evidently an old hand at the game. He too sent
his craft up until it was on a level with the <i>Comet</i>.
But the latter maintained her advantage, and even
increased it, until, that afternoon, the red balloon
was only a quarter of a mile ahead.</p>

<p>“Can we beat them?” asked Jerry anxiously.</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford nodded.</p>

<p>“I haven’t run the motor to the limit yet,” he
said, “and I fancy they have. I’ll pass them at
dusk.”</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford made good his boast. All that
afternoon he was slowly creeping up on the red
balloon, though the crew of it made strenuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
efforts to increase their lead. The inventor of the
<i>Comet</i> did not want to speed his motor too much
during the heat of the day, as it was air-cooled,
and had no water jacket. But as soon as the sun
began to decline and it became cooler, he opened
it up, and with an increase in the explosions that
made it seem as if the <i>Comet</i> was saluting her
rival, the motor ship passed the red airship, being
several hundred feet above her in the air.</p>

<p>As the motor boys and their friends passed they
heard a faint cheer from those below them. They
sent back an answering one and continued on.</p>

<p>“Now there’s nothing to stop us from winning
the race,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Only the fact that there might still be another
airship ahead of us,” said Mr. Glassford. “There
is no telling about that. One of the other contestants
may have outstripped the red balloon.”</p>

<p>The boys had to admit that this might be so,
but in their hearts they hoped that it was not the
case. For they did want the honor of winning
at least one prize, while Bob made no secret of
his desire to see both captured.</p>

<p>As night settled down, with the <i>Comet</i> some
distance ahead of her nearest rival, there sprang up
a stiff wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s not what we want,” observed Mr. Glassford
with a dubious shake of his head.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Because it’s forcing us to the west again. I
don’t see how we can reach New Orleans at this
rate.”</p>

<p>On and on they sped, over mountains and valleys&mdash;on
and on through the silent night. Ned,
Bob and Jerry took turns in the steering tower,
so Mr. Glassford could get some rest. On and on
rushed the big motor ship, her propellers ceaselessly
revolving, and pulling her farther and farther
on her course. Only the wind was still contrary,
and was forcing them too much to the west.</p>

<p>It was just getting daylight when Jerry awoke
with a start. There was a peculiar odor in the
air about them. He sniffed vigorously for a second
or two, and then leaping from his berth he aroused
Mr. Glassford.</p>

<p>“I think something has happened,” he said as
quietly as he could. “It smells as if the gas was
escaping.”</p>

<p>“It is!” cried the inventor, as he noticed the
peculiar odor. “There is a leak in the gas bag.
We must stop it. I hope it is not a large one.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>OVER THE MISSISSIPPI</small></h2>


<p>“Who is in the pilot house?” asked Mr. Glassford.</p>

<p>“Ned is steering.”</p>

<p>“Tell him to turn the craft about. We’ll go
against the wind a bit, until I see what damage
has been done. You come with me, Jerry; I may
need your help.”</p>

<p>Jerry and Mr. Glassford climbed up to a long,
narrow platform, suspended above the roof of
the cabin of the airship, and held up by cords attached
to the net holding the gas bag. Then they
walked along, inspecting the vapor container for
signs of a hole.</p>

<p>“I’ve found it!” cried Jerry. “Here it is. My,
but that’s a strong gas!”</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t breathe it,” cautioned Mr. Glassford.
“It is quite poisonous, though comparatively
harmless in the open air. I’ll see if I can’t mend
the tear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>But it proved to be a larger one than could be
repaired with the facilities at hand. It seemed
to have been made by some object being fired
through the material of which the bag was made,
and at first Jerry was inclined to think that it was
caused by one of the bullets from Noddy’s airgun.
But a closer inspection by Mr. Glassford showed
that a nut had come loose from one of the iron
braces of the port propeller. The propeller had
evidently whirled it with great force against the
thin material, tearing quite a rent in it.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to lose part of our gas,” admitted
Mr. Glassford as he told Jerry to descend.</p>

<p>“Will it cause us to descend much?”</p>

<p>“Not a great deal. I can throw overboard
some of the sand ballast, and we will have about
the same buoyancy as we had before.”</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do save to let the gas
escape. Mr. Glassford opened some of the bags
of sand and allowed the contents to run out. The
effect was to keep the motor ship about at the same
level.</p>

<p>“It seems to be going along as well as ever,”
said Jerry. “You were wise to divide the gas bag
into sections.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> continued to speed on. There was
now no sight of any of the competing airships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and our friends were hoping that they had left
them behind. One thing worried them, however&mdash;the
fact that the wind was still bearing them westward.</p>

<p>It was about noon when Ned, who was looking
from the cabin window, uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“We’re approaching a big body of water,” he
said. “I can see it sparkling below.”</p>

<p>“That’s a river, and it’s a mighty big one,” said
Jerry, coming to the window and looking down.
“I must tell Mr. Glassford. Perhaps it will give
him his bearings.”</p>

<p>But the inventor had already seen the stream.
As Jerry had said, it was a very wide one.</p>

<p>“That’s the Mississippi River,” declared Mr.
Glassford. “Now I know where we are, but just
how far south I can’t say. I think I’ll drop down
a bit, and perhaps we can get some information.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we drop some messages, too?” asked
Jerry. “I think the folks at home will be anxious
about us. Let’s write some messages containing
a request that whoever picks them up should report
us.”</p>

<p>“A good idea,” declared the inventor. “Write
your messages, boys, and I’ll send the motor ship
as close to the earth as is safe. But I’ll not do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
until we cross the river. I have no desire for a
bath now.”</p>

<p>The airship, deflected by the depressed rudder,
went lower and lower. As the travelers came
closer the river loomed larger and larger, until
they could make out boats upon it. Then they saw
a large city, slightly to the south.</p>

<p>“Let’s cross that,” suggested Ned. “We can
find out where we are, then.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was headed right across the city,
and as it approached lower and nearer to it the
travelers could see people running about the streets
in great excitement and pointing upward.</p>

<p>“Take the telescope and see if you can make out
the names on any of the buildings,” suggested Mr.
Glassford, and Ned did so.</p>

<p>“It’s Vicksburg!” he cried. “I see the name
‘Vicksburg National Bank.’”</p>

<p>“I did not think we were so far south as that,”
remarked Mr. Glassford. “If we don’t look out
we’ll be over the Gulf of Mexico. Better drop
your messages, boys.”</p>

<p>The telegrams, with a note of explanation, had
been encased in light wooden cylinders, with ribbons
attached. As the motor ship passed over
the center of the city the boys dropped their messages.
They could see the people running after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
them, waving their hands, and shouting, but they
could distinguish no words.</p>

<p>“We’ll go up now,” observed the inventor; and
while a vast concourse of people gazed upward at
the strange sight, the <i>Comet</i> was headed upward.</p>

<p>A little later it was sailing over the broad
Mississippi River, and the travelers in the air
crossed from the State of Mississippi to that of
Louisiana.</p>

<p>They continued to go up for some time, and
then Mr. Glassford, desiring to make as long a
flight as possible, now that it was impossible to
land at New Orleans, steered due west, intending
to cross over into Texas if possible.</p>

<p>“We must make as long a flight as we can,” he
explained, “and if we go much farther south we’ll
be over the Gulf. Our ship is behaving admirably,
and there is no reason why we cannot cover part
of Texas.”</p>

<p>“Have we gasolene enough?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Enough for about six hundred miles yet, and
that will just about do it,” said the inventor.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>WINNING THE PRIZES&mdash;CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>Aided by a favorable wind, the <i>Comet</i> sailed
on and on. Mr. Glassford was now running the
motor to the limit of speed, as he wanted to cover
as much ground as possible, and he knew that his
gas would not last much longer and that his gasolene
was getting low.</p>

<p>“We made two hundred and fifty miles to-day,”
he announced one evening to the boys. “If we
do as well to-morrow we shall have almost crossed
Texas.”</p>

<p>After breakfast the next morning, Mr. Glassford
made an inspection of various gages and registering
instruments, and then came into the cabin.
Jerry was in the tower, steering.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said the inventor. “I think we’ll
land pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Because we’re on the last pint of gasolene. I
shall be content to drop down now. I think we
have gone over a large extent of territory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>There came a sort of gasp from the motor.
The explosion suddenly ceased. Mr. Glassford
hurried to the pilot house, but before he reached
it Jerry called out:</p>

<p>“Gasolene’s gone. I guess we’ll have to go
down, Mr. Glassford.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. Don’t open the gas valves,
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because there’s a good stiff breeze, and it will
carry us several miles yet. We want to make all
the distance we can.”</p>

<p>Her own motive power having given out, the
<i>Comet</i> was now carried forward by the wind. The
motor ship proved a good craft, even under these
conditions, but toward afternoon the wind died
away, and after taking an observation through the
telescope and seeing a good-sized town a few
miles ahead, Mr. Glassford depressed the elevation
rudder and opened the gas valves.</p>

<p>Down, down, down, on a long slant, started the
airship, after her lengthy voyage. She was at
such an elevation that the slanting descent carried
the craft to the very center of the town, the inhabitants
flocking out by hundreds to see the wonderful
sight.</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford so manipulated the aeroplanes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
that the <i>Comet</i> landed almost as gently as a
feather. Then, in order that it might not take
flight again when the passengers alighted, all the
gas was let out of the bag. The motor ship’s
voyage was over for the time being.</p>

<p>“Where ye from, strangers?” cried a big man
as he pushed his way through the throng that had
gathered about the airship.</p>

<p>“From Park Haven, Indiana,” replied Mr.
Glassford. “Ours is one of the ships that took
part in the race. Have you seen any others out
this way?”</p>

<p>“Nary a one, stranger, and we don’t want to
see any more. It pretty nigh frightened all our
people to death, and half the hosses in town bolted
when ye come sailin’ down from the sky.”</p>

<p>“Where are we?” asked Mr. Glassford.</p>

<p>“Albemarle, Texas.”</p>

<p>“What part of Texas?”</p>

<p>“Within two miles of the Rio Grande. You’re
not far from Mexico.”</p>

<p>“Then we had a longer flight than I thought,”
said the inventor. “Come, boys, we must send
some messages.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it will be safe to leave the airship
here?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I think so. We will not be gone long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, Santa Maria! The saints be praised! If
it is not my very good friends the motor boys!
And the little professor! Let me embrace them!
It is a thousand years since I have seen them!”</p>

<p>A man, who had every appearance of being a
Mexican, pushed his way through the throng. He
was smoking a cigarette, but as he advanced he
threw it away and held open his arms as if in welcome.
The boys stared at him in some wonderment.</p>

<p>“Ah, do not say you have forgotten me!” cried
the Mexican. “Do you not recall the terrible
storm, and how you crashed into my houseboat?”</p>

<p>“It is Don Alvarzo!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Ah! I knew they would not forget!” cried
the man. “I am indeed Don Miguel Fernandez
Alvarzo, your most devoted servant,” and he took
off his sombrero, heavy with silver braid, and
made a low bow. “How are you all?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Is he a friend of yours?” asked Mr. Glassford
in a low voice of Ned, for the man had hold of
Jerry’s two hands and was shaking them frantically.</p>

<p>“We met him when we made a trip through
Mexico,” said Ned as he recalled what had happened
at the Don’s house, as told in the third volume
of this series, “The Motor Boys in Mexico.”</p>

<p>The Mexican shook hands, in turn, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
other boys, the professor, and Mr. Glassford. He
explained that he was now traveling about, buying
wool, and in the course of his travels he had arrived
at this Texas town.</p>

<p>“You must be my guests while you are here,”
he said, and he would not take no for an answer.
He insisted on the aeronauts coming to the hotel
where he was stopping, and thither they went, followed
by a curious throng.</p>

<p>The boys sent telegrams to their parents, announcing
their safe arrival, and Mr. Glassford
wired to the secretary of the aero carnival, reporting
how many miles they had covered, and how
long they had been in the air.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll wait for an answer,” he said, “and
see if we have won a prize.”</p>

<p>“In the meanwhile, you must have some refreshment,”
declared the Don, and he insisted on an
elaborate meal being served, to which he invited
all the city officials, and made the boys, Mr. Glassford
and Professor Snodgrass guests of honor.</p>

<p>In the midst of the banquet a boy brought in a
telegram for Mr. Glassford. He read it quickly.</p>

<p>“Good news, boys!” he cried. “We win!”</p>

<p>“Do we get a prize?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Two of them,” replied the inventor. “We
win the long-distance prize, for we traveled two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
hundred and sixty-five miles farther than the big
red balloon, and we were in the air four hours
and a half longer!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Ned. “That’s the stuff!”</p>

<p>“Señors!” exclaimed Don Alvarzo, “I call for
three American cheers for the brave travelers of
the upper air!”</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will.</p>

<p>A little later telegrams of congratulation were
received from the boys’ parents. One of the telegrams,
from Mrs. Hopkins, stated that the pocketbook
Jerry had dropped from the airship had been
found by a farmer living near Broadlands, and
he had returned the same with its contents, and
claimed the reward.</p>

<p>“That’s all right!” declared Jerry, highly
pleased. “I was afraid I’d never hear of that
money again.”</p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent in an impromptu
celebration, the whole town, in which lived many
Mexican friends of the Don, joining in, glad of
any excuse to have a holiday.</p>

<p>That night the airship was packed for transportation,
and though the Don urged the travelers
to make their visit longer, they departed for Cresville
the next morning.</p>

<p>“Well, it was a success,” said Jerry as they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
rapidly steaming north. “I didn’t think we would
get both prizes. It more than pays us for the expenses
we were under.”</p>

<p>“Then we can take more trips,” said Bob quickly.
“We will try a longer flight next time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I hope our adventures in the air have
only just begun,” added Ned.</p>

<p>The boys did have further adventures, as will
be related in the next book of the series, to be
entitled “The Motor Boys Across the Rockies;
Or, A Mystery of the Air.” In that story we shall
meet all of our friends again in adventures even
more thrilling than those encountered in the past.
We shall also see what Noddy Nixon, who escaped
from the hands of the law, did to injure
them.</p>

<p>There was a great crowd at the Cresville depot
waiting to welcome the motor boys and their
friends, for Jerry had sent a telegram home, telling
his mother when they would arrive, and the
news spread.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! You’re the stuff! Win two prizes!
Shoot through the air! Never come down! I
wish I had been there! Whoop-la!”</p>

<p>This was, of course, little Andy Rush.</p>

<p>“Let’s form a procession!” he cried. “Come
on, strike up the band!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>And sure enough, a small brass band, which the
irrepressible youth had hired, began to play “See
the Conquering Hero Comes!”</p>

<p>“March ’em through town!” went on Andy.
“Here they are, girls!”</p>

<p>“Oh, weren’t you dreadfully frightened?” cried
Mollie Horton, who, with Alice Vines and Helen
Gale, besides several other girls, had come down
to the station to greet the boys.</p>

<p>“Not a bit!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Then the band struck up another air, Andy ran
to form the procession, taking his place at the head
of it, and, though they did not exactly like it, the
motor boys were forced to allow themselves to be
thus honored.</p>

<p>The procession moved away from the depot
and crossed the little square where the flagpole was
set up.</p>

<p>“Speech! speech!” cried several as they caught
sight of the band-stand. “Give us a speech about
your trip.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to make any speech,” murmured
Jerry, who was rather bashful. Nor was Mr.
Glassford accustomed to talking in public.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!” cried Andy.</p>

<p>“Certainly, I shall be delighted,” replied the
scientist. “Friends,” he went on, stepping forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and making a low bow, “we had a most wonderful
trip. High up among the clouds as we were,
far above the earth, skimming along with the speed
of the wind, free, unhampered, masters of the
upper regions, there&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried the crowd.</p>

<p>“There, if I may be permitted to continue,”
went on the scientist, “I found more kinds of bugs
than I ever imagined there were. It was a most
delightful trip.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!” shouted the throng,
half of the people not hearing what Mr. Snodgrass
was saying.</p>

<p>But the scientist had said all he cared to. He
bowed, the crowd cheered again, and Jerry whispered
to his chums:</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s get out of here. I’ve had
enough.”</p>

<p>They slipped from the platform, and before
those who sought to honor them could interpose,
the motor boys were hastening toward their homes,
greatly pleased with their first trip in the clouds.</p>
